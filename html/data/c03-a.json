For the vast majority of species, transcriptomes are still largely uncharacterized and even in those where substantial information is available it is often in the form of partially sequenced transcriptomes. With the development of next generation sequencing, a single experiment can now simultaneously identify the transcribed part of a species genome and estimate levels of gene expression. RESULTS: mRNA from actively growing needles of Norway spruce (Picea abies) was sequenced using next generation sequencing technology. In total, close to 70 million fragments with a length of 76 bp were sequenced resulting in 5 Gbp of raw data. A de novo assembly of these reads, together with publicly available expressed sequence tag (EST) data from Norway spruce, was used to create a reference transcriptome. Of the 38,419 PUTs (putative unique transcripts) longer than 150 bp in this reference assembly, 83.5% show similarity to ESTs from other spruce species and of the remaining PUTs, 3,704 show similarity to protein sequences from other plant species, leaving 4,167 PUTs with limited similarity to currently available plant proteins. By predicting coding frames and comparing not only the Norway spruce PUTs, but also PUTs from the close relatives Picea glauca and Picea sitchensis to both Pinus taeda and Taxus mairei, we obtained estimates of synonymous and non-synonymous divergence among conifer species. In addition, we detected close to 15,000 SNPs of high quality and estimated gene expression differences between samples collected under dark and light conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study yielded a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms as well as estimates of gene expression on transcriptome scale. In agreement with a recent study we find that the synonymous substitution rate per year (0.6 × 10-09 and 1.1 × 10-09) is an order of magnitude smaller than values reported for angiosperm herbs. However, if one takes generation time into account, most of this difference disappears. The estimates of the dN/dS ratio (non-synonymous over synonymous divergence) reported here are in general much lower than 1 and only a few genes showed a ratio larger than 1."],"journal":"BMC genomics","species":["Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea sitchensis","Pinus taeda","Taxus mairei","Drosophila melanogaster","Picea glauca","Picea sitchensis","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea sitchensis","Picea sitchensis","Picea glauca","Picea glauca","Picea sitchensis","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea sitchensis","Pinus taeda","Taxus mairei","Pinus taeda","Taxus mairei","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea sitchensis","Picea abies","Picea abies","A. thaliana","Picea glauca","Picea sitchensis","Picea sitchensis","Picea glauca","Picea sitchensis","Picea glauca","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea glauca","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea sitchensis","Taxus mairei","Pinus taeda","Picea abies","Picea taeda","Picea glauca","Picea taeda","Picea glauca","Taxus mairei","Picea sitchensis","Picea taeda","Picea sitchensis","Taxus mairei","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea sitchensis","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea sitchensis","Picea glauca","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea taeda","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea glauca","Picea abies","Picea sitchensis","Picea taeda","Picea glauca","Picea menziesii","Picea taeda","Picea sitchensis","Arabidopsis thaliana","Populus trichocarpa","Arabidopsis thaliana","Picea trichocarpa","Arabidopsis thaliana","Arabidopsis lyrata","Picea trichocarpa","Picea tremula","Picea abies","E. coli","Picea abies","Picea abies","Taxus mairei","Picea sitchensis","Picea glauca","Picea glauca","Pinus taeda","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea sitchensis","Pinus taeda","Taxus mairei","Pinus taeda","Picea abies","Taxus mairei"],"genera":["Picea","Arabidopsis","Populus","Picea","Picea","Picea","Pinus","Picea","Taxus","Picea","Picea","Taxus"]},"PMC3547014":{"title":["A genome-wide association study identifies genomic regions for virulence in the non-model organism Heterobasidion annosum s.s."],"authors":["Dalman K, Himmelstrand K, Olson Å, Lind M, Brandström-Durling M, Stenlid J."],"doi":["10.1371/journal.pone.0053525"],"abstract":["The dense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) panels needed for genome wide association (GWA) studies have hitherto been expensive to establish and use on non-model organisms.

Results of 250 years of common garden experiments show that most forest trees have evolved local adaptation, as evidenced by the adaptive differentiation of populations in quantitative traits, reflecting environmental conditions of population origins. On the basis of the patterns of quantitative variation for 19 adaptation-related traits studied in 59 tree species (mostly temperate and boreal species from the Northern hemisphere), we found that genetic differentiation between populations and clinal variation along environmental gradients were very common (respectively, 90% and 78% of cases). Thus, responding to climate change will likely require that the quantitative traits of populations again match their environments. We examine what kind of information is needed for evaluating the potential to respond, and what information is already available. We review the genetic models related to selection responses, and what is known currently about the genetic basis of the traits. We address special problems to be found at the range margins, and highlight the need for more modeling to understand specific issues at southern and northern margins. We need new common garden experiments for less known species. For extensively studied species, new experiments are needed outside the current ranges. Improving genomic information will allow better prediction of responses. Competitive and other interactions within species and interactions between species deserve more consideration.

In tropical regions, both woody Al accumulator and non-Al accumulator plants occur, whereas in boreal regions woody plants are non-Al accumulators.

We have cloned 11 WOX genes from both mRNA and genomic DNA and examined their phylogenetic relationship to WOX genes from other species as well as their expression during somatic embryogenesis and in adult tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that all major radiations within the WOX gene family took place before the angiosperm-gymnosperm split and that there has been a recent expansion within the intermediate clade in the Pinaceae family. Furthermore, we show that the genes from the intermediate clade are preferentially expressed during embryo development in Picea abies.

We conducted a survey to characterize forest stand diversity and structure in plots occurring between 2050 and 3350 m in elevation. We also evaluated seedling and sapling recruitment and tree-ring data from four conifer species to assess: 1) whether the forest appears in transition toward increased hardwood composition; 2) if conifers appear stressed by recent climate change relative to hardwoods; and 3) how growth of four dominant species responds to recent climate. Our study is complicated by clear evidence of 20(th) century timber extraction. Focusing on regions lacking evidence of logging, we found a diverse suite of conifers (Pinus, Abies, Juniperus, Picea, and Larix) strongly dominate the forest overstory. We found population size structures for most conifer tree species to be consistent with self-replacement and not providing evidence of shifting composition toward hardwoods. Climate-growth analyses indicate increased growth with cool temperatures in summer and fall. Warmer temperatures during the growing season could negatively impact conifer growth, indicating possible seasonal climate water deficit as a constraint on growth. In contrast, however, we found little relationship to seasonal precipitation. Projected warming does not yet have a discernible signal on trends in tree growth rates, but slower growth with warmer growing season climates suggests reduced potential future forest growth."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["Abies fargesii","Larix potaninii","Picea purpurea","Pinus tabuliformis","Larix potaninii","Picea tabuliformis","Abies fargesii","Picea purpurea","Abies fargesii","Picea asperata","J. saltuaria","Picea tabuliformis","Picea purpurea","Quercus liaotungensis","Abies fargesii","Picea tabuliformis","Pinus tabuliformis","Larix potannii","Picea purpurea","Abies fargesii","Picea tabuliformis","B. albosinensis","B. platyphylla","B. utilis","B. utilis","Pinus tabuliformis","Betula albosinensis","Picea tabuliformis","Betula albosinensis","Abies fargesii","Larix potaninii","Picea tabuliformis","Larix potaninii","Picea tabuliformis","Abies fargesii","Larix potaninii","Picea purpurea","Pinus tabuliformis","Abies fargesii","Larix potaninii","Picea purpurea","Picea purpurea","Picea tabuliformis","Abies fargesii","Larix potaninii","Picea purpurea","Pinus tabuliformis","Betula platyphylla","Betula albosinensis","Picea tabuliformis","Picea tabuliformis","Abies fargesii","Picea tabuliformis","Abies fargesii","Picea tabuliformis","Picea tabuliformis","Abies fargesii","Abies faxoniana","Picea tabuliformis","Picea purpurea"],"genera":["Larix","Abies","Picea"]},"PMC3753317":{"title":["Tree migration-rates: narrowing the gap between inferred post-glacial rates and projected rates."],"authors":["Feurdean A, Bhagwat SA, Willis KJ, Birks HJ, Lischke H, Hickler T."],"doi":["10.1371/journal.pone.0071797"],"abstract":["Faster-than-expected post-glacial migration rates of trees have puzzled ecologists for a long time. In Europe, post-glacial migration is assumed to have started from the three southern European peninsulas (southern refugia), where large areas remained free of permafrost and ice at the peak of the last glaciation. However, increasing palaeobotanical evidence for the presence of isolated tree populations in more northerly microrefugia has started to change this perception. Here we use the Northern Eurasian Plant Macrofossil Database and palaeoecological literature to show that post-glacial migration rates for trees may have been substantially lower (60-260 m yr(-1)) than those estimated by assuming migration from southern refugia only (115-550 m yr(-1)), and that early-successional trees migrated faster than mid- and late-successional trees. Post-glacial migration rates are in good agreement with those recently projected for the future with a population dynamical forest succession and dispersal model, mainly for early-successional trees and under optimal conditions. Although migration estimates presented here may be conservative because of our assumption of uniform dispersal, tree migration-rates clearly need reconsideration. We suggest that small outlier populations may be a key factor in understanding past migration rates and in predicting potential future range-shifts. The importance of outlier populations in the past may have an analogy in the future, as many tree species have been planted beyond their natural ranges, with a more beneficial microclimate than their regional surroundings. Therefore, climate-change-induced range-shifts in the future might well be influenced by such microrefugia."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["P. abies","P. sylvestris","P. sibirica","Q. pubescens","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea abies","Fagus sylvatica","Abies alba","Fagus sylvatica","Carpinus betulus","Abies alba","Picea abies","Picea abies","Fagus sylvatica","Picea abies"],"genera":["Alnus","Pinus","Picea","Pinus","Picea","Quercus","Quercus","Picea","Picea"]},"PMC3762812":{"title":["Insights into the loblolly pine genome: characterization of BAC and fosmid sequences."],"authors":["Wegrzyn JL, Lin BY, Zieve JJ, Dougherty WM, Martínez-García PJ, Koriabine M, Holtz-Morris A, deJong P, Crepeau M, Langley CH, Puiu D, Salzberg SL, Neale DB, Stevens KA."],"doi":["10.1371/journal.pone.0072439"],"abstract":["Despite their prevalence and importance, the genome sequences of loblolly pine, Norway spruce, and white spruce, three ecologically and economically important conifer species, are just becoming available to the research community.

Similarity analysis estimated a repetitive content of 27% that included both full and partial elements. When combined with the de novo investigation, the estimate increased to almost 86%. Over 60% of the repetitive sequence consists of full or partial LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons.

Resin foraging is difficult to approach experimentally because resin composition is highly variable among and between plant families, the environmental and plant-genotypic effects on resins are unknown, and resin foragers are relatively rare and often forage in unobservable tree canopies. Subsequently, little is known about the botanical origins of resins in many regions or the benefits of specific resins to bees. We used metabolomic methods as a type of environmental forensics to track individual resin forager behavior through comparisons of global resin metabolite patterns. The resin from the corbiculae of a single bee was sufficient to identify that resin's botanical source without prior knowledge of resin composition. Bees from our apiary discriminately foraged for resin from eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), and balsam poplar (P. balsamifera) among many available, even closely related, resinous plants. Cottonwood and balsam poplar resin composition did not show significant seasonal or regional changes in composition. Metabolomic analysis of resin from 6 North American Populus spp. and 5 hybrids revealed peaks characteristic to taxonomic nodes within Populus, while antimicrobial analysis revealed that resin from different species varied in inhibition of the bee bacterial pathogen, Paenibacillus larvae. We conclude that honey bees make discrete choices among many resinous plant species, even among closely related species. Bees also maintained fidelity to a single source during a foraging trip. Furthermore, the differential inhibition of P. larvae by Populus spp., thought to be preferential for resin collection in temperate regions, suggests that resins from closely related plant species many have different benefits to bees."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["Apis mellifera","Populus deltoides","Populus balsamifera","Populus spp","Paenibacillus larvae","Populus larvae","Populus spp","Apis mellifera","Paenibacillus larvae","Populus spp","Aesculus hippocastanum","Pinus spp","Picea spp","Populus deltoides","Populus deltoides","Populus balsamifera","Populus balsamifera","Populus deltoides","Populus larvae","Populus deltoides","Pinus spp","Picea spp","Populus balsamifera","Abies balsamea","Pseudotsuga menziesii","Larix laricina","Aesculus hippocastanum","Populus tremuloides","Populus grandentata","Populus deltoides","Populus balsamifera","Apis balsamea","Paenibacillus larvae","Populus larvae","Populus gluaca","Apis hippocastanum","Populus sylvestris","Populus larvae","Paenibacillus larvae","Populus balsamifera","Populus deltoides","Populus deltoides","Populus balsamifera","Populus deltoides","Populus spp","Populus deltoides","Populus balsamifera","Populus deltoides","Populus deltoides","Populus balsamifera","Populus balsamifera","Populus balsamifera","Populus balsamifera","Populus balsamifera","Populus deltoides","Populus balsamifera","Populus deltoides","Populus deltoides","Populus spp","Populus spp","Populus balsamifera","Populus angustifolia","Populus trichocarpa","Populus nigra","Populus deltoides","Populus fremontii","Populus deltoides","Populus deltoides","Populus trichocarpa","Populus angustifolia","Populus deltoides","Populus angustifolia","Populus balsamifera","Populus trichocarpa","Populus deltoides","Populus nigra","Populus fremontii","Populus trichocarpa","Populus angustifolia","Populus balsamifera","Populus deltoides","Populus fremontii","Populus angustifolia","Populus balsamifera","Populus trichocarpa","Populus larvae","Populus trichocarpa","Populus angustifolia","Populus spp","Populus larvae","B. dracunculifolia","Populus balsamifera","Populus deltoides","Populus deltoides","Populus larvae","Populus deltoides","Populus balsamifera","Populus larvae","Populus balsamifera","Populus deltoides","Populus deltoides","Populus balsamifera","Ascosphaera apis"],"genera":["Drosophila","Anopheles","Populus","Betula","Salix","Alnus","Aesculus","Hymenaea","Populus","Populus","Populus","Populus"]},"PMC3823978":{"title":["Molecular characterization and development of real-time PCR assay for pine-wood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Nematoda: Parasitaphelenchidae)."],"authors":["Ye W, Giblin-Davis RM."],"doi":["10.1371/journal.pone.0078804"],"abstract":["Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the pine-wood nematode (PWN), is the causal agent of pine wilt disease, one of the most damaging emerging pest problems to forests around the world.

We additionally observe that the placement of Ginkgo inferred from coalescent analyses is congruent across different nucleotide rate partitions. In contrast, the standard concatenation method produces strongly supported, but incongruent placements of Ginkgo between slow- and fast-evolving sites. Specifically, fast-evolving sites yield relationships in conflict with coalescent analyses. We hypothesize that this incongruence may be related to the way in which concatenation methods treat sites with elevated nucleotide substitution rates.

We test, on subalpine tree species, the relationship between the flammability of bark and its insulating ability, identifies the biological traits that determine bark flammability, and assesses their relative susceptibility to surface fires from their bark properties. The experimental set of burning properties was analyzed by Principal Component Analysis to assess the bark flammability. Bark insulating ability was expressed by the critical time to cambium kill computed from bark thickness. Log-linear regressions indicated that bark flammability varies with the bark thickness and the density of wood under bark and that the most flammable barks have poor insulating ability. Susceptibility to surface fires increases from gymnosperm to angiosperm subalpine trees. The co-dominant subalpine species Larix decidua (Mill.) and Pinus cembra (L.) exhibit large differences in both flammability and insulating ability of the bark that should partly explain their contrasted responses to fires in the past.

Insights from a molecular phylogeny of the conifer-feeding genus Cinara."],"authors":["Jousselin E, Cruaud A, Genson G, Chevenet F, Foottit RG, Cœur d'acier A."],"doi":["10.1186/1742-9994-10-56"],"abstract":[" INTRODUCTION: In the past decade ecological speciation has been recognized as having an important role in the diversification of plant-feeding insects. Aphids are host-specialised phytophagous insects that mate on their host plants and, as such, they are prone to experience reproductive isolation linked with host plant association that could ultimately lead to species formation. The generality of such a scenario remains to be tested through macroevolutionary studies. To explore the prevalence of host-driven speciation in the diversification of the aphid genus Cinara and to investigate alternative modes of speciation, we reconstructed a phylogeny of this genus based on mitochondrial, nuclear and Buchnera aphidicola DNA sequence fragments and applied a DNA-based method of species delimitation. Using a recent software (PhyloType), we explored evolutionary transitions in host-plant genera, feeding sites and geographic distributions in the diversification of Cinara and investigated how transitions in these characters have accompanied speciation events. RESULTS: The diversification of Cinara has been constrained by host fidelity to conifer genera sometimes followed by sequential colonization onto different host species and by feeding-site specialisation. Nevertheless, our analyses suggest that, at the most, only half of the speciation events were accompanied by ecological niche shifts. The contribution of geographical isolation in the speciation process is clearly apparent in the occurrence of species from two continents in the same clades in relatively terminal positions in our phylogeny. Furthermore, in agreement with predictions from scenarios in which geographic isolation accounts for speciation events, geographic overlap between species increased significantly with time elapsed since their separation. CONCLUSIONS: The history of Cinara offers a different perspective on the mode of speciation of aphids than that provided by classic models such as the pea aphid. In this genus of aphids, the role of climate and landscape history has probably been as important as host-plant specialisation in having shaped present-day diversity."],"journal":"Frontiers in zoology","species":["Buchnera aphidicola","Rhagoletis pomonella","Acyrthosiphon pisum","Aphis gossypii","C. pinea","C. pergandei","C. confinis","Buchnera aphidicola","Buchnera aphidicola","Buchnera aphidicola","Buchnera aphidicola","Cinara ponderosae","Cinara terminalis","Cinara pini","Cinara pilicornis","Cinara pruinosa","Cinara pseudotaxifoliae","Cinara occidentalis","Pinus lambertiana","Cinara moketa","Cinara anelia","Pinus monophylla","Cinara moketa","Pinus lambertiana","Cinara anelia","Pinus contorta","Cinara murrayanae","Cinara medispinosa","Cinara contortae","Cinara murrayanae","Cinara brevispinosa","Cinara engelmanniensis","Cinara bonica","Cinara wahluca","Cinara cedri","Cinara curtihirsuta","Cinara cembrae","Cinara pilicornis","Cinara pruinosa","Cinara ponderosae","Cinara occidentalis","Cinara terminalis","Pinus contorta","Cinara pilicornis","Cinara pruinosa","Cinara splendens","Cinara pseudotsugae","Cinara ponderosae","Cinara pilicornis","Cinara pinea","Cinara pilicornis","Pinus ponderosa","Pinus lambertiana","Cinara pruinosa","Cinara pilicornis"],"genera":["Cinara","Cinara","Cinara","Cinara","Cinara","Cinara","Cinara","Cinara","Cinara","Cupressobium","Cinara","Cinara","Buchnera","Cinara","Pseudotsuga","Cinara","Cupressus","Size","Different","Cinara","Cinara","Abies","Picea","Picea","Picea","Pinus","Pinus","Pinus","Picea","Cinara","Abies","Cinara","Pinus","Pinus","Larix","Pseudotsuga","Size","Different","Persistence","Support","Cinara","Cupressobium","Cinara","Cinara","Cinara","Cinara","Pinus","Cinara","Cupressus","Cinara","Tsuga","Cedrus","Pseudotsuga","Abies","Cinara","Pinus","Cinara","Larix","Cinara","Megastigmus","Pseudotsuga","Larix","Dendroctonus","Cinara","Cinara","Cinara","Cinara","Picea","Cinara","Picea","Picea","Picea","Cinara","Cinara"]},"PMC3885877":{"title":["500-year climate cycles stacking of recent centennial warming documented in an East Asian pollen record."],"authors":["Xu D, Lu H, Chu G, Wu N, Shen C, Wang C, Mao L."],"doi":["10.1038/srep03611"],"abstract":["Here we presented a high-resolution 5350-year pollen record from a maar annually laminated lake in East Asia (EA).

We identified 140 species from 9273 adult spiders. Spider communities were distinguished between deciduous and coniferous trees.

A tree-species-specific pattern was clearly observed for Alnus, Carpinus, Picea and Pinus trees and also for those tree species that were fogged in only four or three replicates, namely Betula and Populus. This hitherto unrecognised association was mainly due to the community composition of common species identified in a Dufrene-Legendre indicator species analysis. It was not caused by spatial or temporal autocorrelation. Explaining tree-species specificity for generalist predators like spiders is difficult and has to involve physical and ecological tree parameters like linkage with the abundance of prey species.

Here we present nucleotide diversity data from 19 genes putatively involved in photoperiodic response in Norway spruce (Picea abies). Based on similarity to model plants the genes were grouped into three categories according to their presumed position in the photoperiod pathway: photoreceptors, circadian clock genes, and downstream targets. An HKA (Hudson, Kreitman and Aquade) test showed a significant excess of diversity at photoreceptor genes, but no departure from neutrality at circadian genes and downstream targets. Departures from neutrality were also tested with Tajima's D and Fay and Wu's H statistics under three demographic scenarios: the standard neutral model, a population expansion model, and a more complex population split model. Only one gene, the circadian clock gene PaPRR3 with a highly positive Tajima's D value, deviates significantly from all tested demographic scenarios.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Field survey was conducted in the natural Pinus koraiensis mixed forests along a latitudinal gradient and an elevational gradient in Northeast China. In order to build the mathematical models for simulating the relationships of compositional and structural attributes of the Pinus koraiensis mixed forest with climatic and non-climatic factors, stepwise linear regression analyses were performed, incorporating 14 dependent variables and the linear and quadratic components of 9 factors. All the selected new models were computed under the +2°C and +10% precipitation and +4°C and +10% precipitation scenarios. The Max Temperature of Warmest Month, Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter and Precipitation of Wettest Month were observed to be key climatic factors controlling the stand densities and total basal areas of Pinus koraiensis mixed forest. Increased summer temperatures and precipitations strongly enhanced the stand densities and total basal areas of broadleaf trees but had little effect on Pinus koraiensis under the +2°C and +10% precipitation scenario and +4°C and +10% precipitation scenario.

Two closely related peptide signalling molecule families are the CLAVATA3-EMBRYO-SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) and CLE-LIKE (CLEL) genes, which encode precursors of secreted peptide ligands that have roles in meristem maintenance and root gravitropism. Progress in peptide signalling molecule research in gymnosperms has lagged behind that of angiosperms. We therefore sought to identify CLE and CLEL genes in gymnosperms and conduct a comparative analysis of these gene families with angiosperms. RESULTS: We undertook a meta-analysis of the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ gymnosperm EST database and the Picea abies and P. glauca genomes and identified 93 putative CLE genes and 11 CLEL genes among eight Pinophyta species, in the genera Cryptomeria, Pinus and Picea. The predicted conifer CLE and CLEL protein sequences had close phylogenetic relationships with their homologues in Arabidopsis. Notably, perfect conservation of the active CLE dodecapeptide in presumed orthologues of the Arabidopsis CLE41/44-TRACHEARY ELEMENT DIFFERENTIATION (TDIF) protein, an inhibitor of tracheary element (xylem) differentiation, was seen in all eight conifer species. We cloned the Pinus radiata CLE41/44-TDIF orthologues. These genes were preferentially expressed in phloem in planta as expected, but unexpectedly, also in differentiating tracheary element (TE) cultures. Surprisingly, transcript abundances of these TE differentiation-inhibitors sharply increased during early TE differentiation, suggesting that some cells differentiate into phloem cells in addition to TEs in these cultures. Applied CLE13 and CLE41/44 peptides inhibited root elongation in Pinus radiata seedlings. We show evidence that two CLEL genes are alternatively spliced via 3'-terminal acceptor exons encoding separate CLEL peptides. CONCLUSIONS: The CLE and CLEL genes are found in conifers and they exhibit at least as much sequence diversity in these species as they do in other plant species. Only one CLE peptide sequence has been 100% conserved between gymnosperms and angiosperms over 300 million years of evolutionary history, the CLE41/44-TDIF peptide and its likely conifer orthologues. The preferential expression of these vascular development-regulating genes in phloem in conifers, as they are in dicot species, suggests close parallels in the regulation of secondary growth and wood formation in gymnosperm and dicot plants. Based on our bioinformatic analysis, we predict a novel mechanism of regulation of the expression of several conifer CLEL peptides, via alternative splicing resulting in the selection of alternative C-terminal exons encoding separate CLEL peptides."],"journal":"BMC plant biology","species":["Picea abies","Picea glauca","Pinus radiata","Arabidopsis thaliana","Physcomitrella patens","Oryza sativa","Populus tremuloides","Chamaecyparis obtusa","Arabidopsis thaliana","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea glauca","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea glauca","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea engelmannii","Picea glauca","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea glauca","Picea sitchensis","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea glauca","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea abies","Pinus contorta","Picea glauca","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea sitchensis","Pinus contorta","Picea glauca","Arabidopsis thaliana","Pinus radiata","Pinus radiata","Pinus radiata","Pinus radiata","Picea taeda","Physcomitrella patens","Picea glauca","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea glauca","Picea glauca","Picea abies","Picea radiata","Phoenix dactylifera","Picea radiata","Picea radiata","Picea radiata","Arabidopsis thaliana","Picea radiata","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea glauca","Pinus radiata","Picea radiata","Picea radiata","Picea radiata","Pinus taeda","Pinus radiata"],"genera":["Pinus","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Pinus","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis"]},"PMC4035765":{"title":["Radial stem growth in response to microclimate and soil moisture in a drought-prone mixed coniferous forest at an inner Alpine site."],"authors":["Oberhuber W, Gruber A, Kofler W, Swidrak I."],"doi":["10.1007/s10342-013-0777-z"],"abstract":["Dendroclimatological studies in a dry inner Alpine environment (750 m a.s.l.) revealed different growth response of co-occurring coniferous species to climate, which is assumed to be caused by a temporal shift in wood formation among species. The main focus of this study therefore was to monitor intra-annual dynamics of radial increment growth of mature deciduous and evergreen coniferous species (Pinus sylvestris, Larix decidua and Picea abies) during two consecutive years with contrasting climatic conditions. Radial stem growth was continuously followed by band dendrometers and modelled using Gompertz functions to determine time of maximum growth. Histological analyses of tree ring formation allowed determination of temporal dynamics of cambial activity and xylem cell development. Daily fluctuations in stem radius and radial stem increments were extracted from dendrometer traces, and correlations with environmental variables were performed. While a shift in temporal dynamics of radial growth onset and cessation was detected among co-occurring species, intra-annual radial growth peaked synchronously in late May 2011 and early June 2012. Moist atmospheric conditions, i.e. high relative air humidity, low vapour pressure deficit and low air temperature during the main growing period, favoured radial stem increment of all species. Soil water content and soil temperature were not significantly related to radial growth. Although a temporal shift in onset and cessation of wood formation was detected among species, synchronous culmination of radial growth indicates homogenous exogenous and/or endogenous control. The close coupling of radial growth to atmospheric conditions points to the importance of stem water status for intra-annual growth of drought-prone conifers."],"journal":"European journal of forest research","species":["Picea abies","Pinus sylvestris","Picea sylvestris","Larix decidua","Picea abies","Picea sylvestris","Larix decidua","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea sylvestris","Larix decidua","Picea sylvestris","Larix decidua","Picea sylvestris","Picea abies","Larix decidua","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea sylvestris","Larix decidua","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea sylvestris","Larix decidua","Picea abies","Picea sylvestris","Picea abies","Larix decidua","Picea sylvestris","Larix decidua","Picea abies","Larix decidua","Picea sylvestris","Picea abies","Larix decidua","Picea abies","Picea sylvestris","Larix decidua","Larix decidua","Picea abies","Picea abies","Larix decidua","Picea abies","Picea sylvestris","Larix decidua","Picea abies","Larix decidua","Picea sylvestris","Picea abies","Larix decidua","Picea sylvestris","Larix decidua","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea sylvestris","Larix decidua","Larix decidua","Picea sylvestris","Larix decidua","A. alba","Picea abies","Picea sylvestris","Picea sylvestris","Larix decidua","Picea abies","Picea sylvestris","Picea sylvestris","Abies balsamea","Larix decidua"],"genera":[]},"PMC4053751":{"title":["Decoding the massive genome of loblolly pine using haploid DNA and novel assembly strategies."],"authors":["Neale DB, Wegrzyn JL, Stevens KA, Zimin AV, Puiu D, Crepeau MW, Cardeno C, Koriabine M, Holtz-Morris AE, Liechty JD, Martínez-García PJ, Vasquez-Gross HA, Lin BY, Zieve JJ, Dougherty WM, Fuentes-Soriano S, Wu LS, Gilbert D, Marçais G, Roberts M, Holt C, Yandell M, Davis JM, Smith KE, Dean JF, Lorenz WW, Whetten RW, Sederoff R, Wheeler N, McGuire PE, Main D, Loopstra CA, Mockaitis K, deJong PJ, Yorke JA, Salzberg SL, Langley CH."],"doi":["10.1186/gb-2014-15-3-r59"],"abstract":["The size and complexity of conifer genomes has, until now, prevented full genome sequencing and assembly.

The long scaffold lengths allow the annotation of 50,172 gene models with intron lengths averaging over 2.7 kbp and sometimes exceeding 100 kbp in length. Analysis of orthologous gene sets identifies gene families that may be unique to conifers.

We explored the general effect of selected parameters by performing simulations and ascertained the best model setting for the Czech Republic using the shallowest samples from 120 fossil sites and data on actual regional vegetation (60 km radius). Vegetation proportions of 17 taxa were obtained by combining the CORINE Land Cover map with forest inventories, agricultural statistics and habitat mapping data. Our simulation shows that changing the site radius for all taxa substantially affects REVEALS estimates of taxa with heavy or light pollen grains. Decreasing the site radius has a similar effect as increasing the wind speed parameter. However, adjusting the site radius to 1 m for local taxa only (even taxa with light pollen) yields lower, more correct estimates despite their high pollen signal. Increasing the background radius does not affect the estimates significantly. Our comparison of estimates with actual vegetation in seven regions shows that the most accurate relative pollen productivity estimates (PPEs) come from Central Europe and Southern Sweden. The initial simulation and pollen data yielded unrealistic estimates for Abies under the default setting of the wind speed parameter (3 m/s). We therefore propose the setting of 4 m/s, which corresponds to the spring average in most regions of the Czech Republic studied. Ad hoc adjustment of PPEs with this setting improves the match 3-4-fold. We consider these values (apart from four exceptions) to be appropriate, because they are within the ranges of standard errors, so they are related to original PPEs. Setting a 1 m radius for local taxa (Alnus, Salix, Poaceae) significantly improves the match between estimates and actual vegetation.

Hillier ex Slavin (also known as Picea balfouriana) is an ecologically and economically important conifer that grows rapidly under optimum conditions and produces high-quality wood. It has a wide geographic distribution and is prevalent in southwest and eastern regions of China. Under suboptimal conditions, P. balfouriana grows slowly, which restricts its cultivation. Somatic embryogenesis has been used in the mass propagation of commercial species. However, low initiation rates are a common problem and the mechanisms involved in the induction of somatic embryogenesis are not fully understood. To understand the molecular mechanisms regulating somatic embryogenesis in P. balfouriana, high-throughput RNA-seq technology was used to investigate the transcriptomes of embryogenic and non-embryogenic tissues from three P. balfouriana genotypes. We compared the genes expressed in these tissues to identify molecular markers with embryogenic potential. RESULTS: A total of 55,078,846 nucleotide sequence reads were obtained for the embryogenic and non-embryogenic tissues of P. balfouriana, and 49.56% of them uniquely matched 22,295 (84.3%) of the 26,437 genes in the Picea abies genome database (Nature 497: 579-584, 2013). Differential gene expression analysis identified 1,418 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate <0.0001; fold change ≥2) in the embryogenic tissues relative to the non-embryogenic tissues, including 431 significantly upregulated and 987 significantly downregulated genes. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis revealed that the most significantly altered genes were involved in plant hormone signal transduction, metabolic pathways (starch and sucrose metabolism), and phenylalanine metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the initiation of embryogenic tissues affected gene expression in many KEGG pathways, but predominantly in plant hormone signal transduction, plant-pathogen interaction, and starch and sucrose metabolism. The changes in multiple pathways related to induction in the P. balfouriana embryogenic tissues described here, will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved in the initiation of somatic embryogenesis. Additionally, we found that somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase (SERK), arabinogalactan proteins, and members of the WUS-related homeobox protein family may play important roles and could act as molecular markers in the early stage of somatic embryogenesis, as reported previously."],"journal":"BMC genomics","species":["Picea likiangensis","Picea balfouriana","Picea balfouriana","Picea balfouriana","Picea balfouriana","Picea balfouriana","Picea abies","Picea balfouriana","Picea balfouriana","Picea balfouriana","Picea balfouriana","Picea balfouriana","Picea abies","Picea balfouriana","Picea balfouriana","Picea balfouriana","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea balfouriana","Picea abies","Picea balfouriana","Picea balfouriana","Picea balfouriana","Picea balfouriana","Picea balfouriana","Medicago sativa","Daucus carota","Dactylis glomerata","Arabidopsis thaliana","Medicago truncatula","Helianthus annuus","Ocotea catharinensis","Citrus unshiu","Theobroma cacao","Daucus glomerata","Arabidopsis thaliana","Arabidopsis thaliana","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea balfouriana","Picea balfouriana","Picea balfouriana","Picea balfouriana","Picea balfouriana","Picea balfouriana","Picea abies","Picea balfouriana","Picea likiangensis"],"genera":[]},"PMC4103479":{"title":["Characterization of microsatellite loci in lichen-forming fungi of Bryoria section Implexae (Parmeliaceae)."],"authors":["Nadyeina O, Cornejo C, Boluda CG, Myllys L, Rico VJ, Crespo A, Scheidegger C."],"abstract":["•The locally rare, haploid, lichen-forming fungi Bryoria capillaris, B. fuscescens, and B. implexa are associated with boreal forests and belong to Bryoria sect.

RESULTS: Gene structure was analyzed for 35 genes of Picea glauca obtained from BAC sequencing and genome assembly, including comparisons with A. thaliana, P. trichocarpa and Z. mays. We aimed to develop an understanding of impact of long introns on the structure of individual genes. The number and length of exons was well conserved among the species compared but on average, P. glauca introns were longer and genes had four times more intronic sequence than Arabidopsis, and 2 times more than poplar and maize. However, pairwise comparisons of individual genes gave variable results and not all contrasts were statistically significant. Genes generally accumulated one or a few longer introns in species with larger genomes but the position of long introns was variable between plant lineages. In P. glauca, highly expressed genes generally had more intronic sequence than tissue preferential genes. Comparisons with the Pinus taeda BACs and genome scaffolds showed a high conservation for position of long introns and for sequence of short introns. A survey of 1836 P. glauca genes obtained by sequence capture mostly containing introns <1 Kbp showed that repeated sequences were 10× more abundant in introns than in exons.

By repeated micro-sampling of the stem, timing of key phenological dates of xylem and phloem formation was compared among mature Pinus sylvestris, Larix decidua and Picea abies during two consecutive years. Xylem formation in P. sylvestris started in mid and late April 2011 and 2012, respectively, and in both years about 2 week later in P. abies and L. decidua. Phloem formation preceded xylem formation on average by 3 week in P. sylvestris, and c. 5 week in P. abies and L. decidua. Based on modeled cell number increase, tracheid production peaked between early through late May 2011 and late May through mid-June 2012. Phloem formation culminated between late April and mid-May in 2011 and in late May 2012. Production of xylem and phloem cells continued for about 4 and 5-6 months, respectively. High variability in xylem increment among years and species is related to exogenous control by climatic factors and species-specific sensitivity to drought, respectively. On the other hand, production of phloem cells was quite homogenous and showed asymptotic decrease with respect to xylem cells indicating endogenous control. Results indicate that onset and culmination of xylem and phloem formation are controlled by early spring temperature, whereby strikingly advanced production of phloem compared to xylem cells suggests lower temperature requirement for initiation of the former."],"journal":"Trees (Berlin, Germany : West)","species":["Pinus sylvestris","Larix decidua","Picea abies","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Larix decidua","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Larix decidua","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Picea abies","Larix decidua","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Larix decidua","Pinus sylvestris","Larix decidua","Pinus abies","Pinus sylvestris","Larix decidua","Pinus abies","Pinus sylvestris","Larix decidua","Pinus abies","Pinus sylvestris","Larix decidua","Pinus abies","Pinus sylvestris","Larix decidua","Pinus abies","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Larix decidua","Scale bar","Pinus sylvestris","Larix decidua","Pinus abies","Pinus abies","Pinus sylvestris","Larix decidua","Pinus abies","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Larix decidua","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Larix decidua","Larix decidua","Pinus abies","Pinus abies","Pinus sylvestris","Larix decidua","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Larix decidua","Larix decidua","Pinus abies","Pinus abies","Larix decidua","Pinus abies","Larix decidua","Larix decidua","Larix decidua","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Larix decidua","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Larix decidua","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Larix decidua","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Larix decidua","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Larix decidua","Larix decidua","Pinus abies","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Larix decidua","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Larix decidua","Larix decidua","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Larix decidua","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Larix decidua","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Abies alba","Pinus abies","Pinus sylvestris","Larix decidua","Larix decidua","Larix decidua","Larix decidua","Pinus abies","Larix decidua","Pinus abies","Pinus sylvestris","Larix decidua","Pinus abies","Pinus sylvestris","Larix decidua","Abies alba","Pinus sylvestris","Larix decidua","Pinus abies","Pinus abies","Pinus abies"],"genera":["Bars"]},"PMC4123385":{"title":["Development and characterization of 25 EST-SSR markers in Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica (Pinaceae)."],"authors":["Fang P, Niu S, Yuan H, Li Z, Zhang Y, Yuan L, Li W."],"abstract":["•A set of novel expressed sequence tag (EST) microsatellite markers was developed in Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica to promote further genetic studies in this species. •One hundred seventy-five EST-simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers were designed and synthesized for 31,653 isotigs based on P. tabuliformis EST sequences.

In spruce (Picea) and other conifers, the development of single-copy polymorphic genomic microsatellite markers is quite difficult, owing primarily to the large genome size and predominance of repetitive DNA sequences throughout the genome. We have developed highly informative single-locus genomic microsatellite markers in black spruce (Picea mariana) and red spruce (Picea rubens) using a simple but efficient method based on a combination of AFLP and microsatellite technologies.A microsatellite-enriched library was constructed from genomic AFLP DNA fragments of black spruce. Sequencing of the 108 putative SSR-containing clones provided 94 unique sequences with microsatellites. Twenty-two of the designed 34 primer pairs yielded scorable amplicons, with single-locus patterns. Fourteen of these microsatellite markers were characterized in 30 black spruce and 30 red spruce individuals drawn from many populations. The number of alleles at a polymorphic locus ranged from 2 to 18, with a mean of 9.3 in black spruce, and from 3 to 15, with a mean of 6.2 alleles in red spruce. The polymorphic information content or expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.340 to 0.909 (mean = 0.67) in black spruce and from 0.161 to 0.851 (mean = 0.62) in red spruce. Ten SSR markers showing inter-parental polymorphism inherited in a single-locus Mendelian mode, with two cases of distorted segregation. Primer pairs for almost all polymorphic SSR loci resolved microsatellites of comparable size in Picea glauca, P. engelmannii, P. sitchensis, and P. abies.The AFLP-based microsatellite-enriched library appears to be a rapid, cost-effective approach for isolating and developing single-locus informative genomic microsatellite markers in black spruce.

We also explore xylem hydraulics, foliar nutrition, and carbohydrate status as drivers for growth and expansion of the lower and upper branches in various types of shading. This study was conducted over a two-year period across 10 regenerating forest sites dominated by lodgepole pine and white spruce, in the lower foothills of Alberta, Canada. Trees were assigned to one of four shading treatments: (1), complete uniform shading of the entire tree, (2) light asymmetric shading where the lower 1/4-1/3 of the tree crown was shaded, (3) heavy asymmetric shading as in (2) except with greater light reduction and (4) control in which no artificial shading occurred and most of the entire crown was exposed to full light. Asymmetrical shading of only the lower crown had a larger negative impact on the bud expansion and growth than did uniform shading, and the effect was stronger in pine relative to spruce. In addition, lower branches in pine also had lower carbon reserves, and reduced xylem-area specific conductivity compared to spruce. For both species, but particularly the pine, the needles of lower branches tended to store less C than upper branches in the asymmetric shade, which could suggest a movement of reserves away from the lower branches. The implications of these findings correspond with the inherent shade tolerance and self-pruning behavior of these conifers and supports a carbon based mechanism for branch mortality--mediated by an asymmetry in light exposure of the crown."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["Pinus contorta","Picea glauca","Pinus taeda","Pinus contorta","Pinus contorta","Abies amabilis","Betula pubescens","Pinus contorta","Picea glauca","Picea mariana","Betula pubescens","Cedrela sinensis","Litsea acuminata","Pinus contorta","Picea glauca","Cecropia pachystachya","Schizolobium parahyba","Pinus contorta","Pseudotsuga menziesii","Tsuga heterophylla","Larix decidua","Cedrela sinensis","Pinus radiata","Picea glauca","Pinus contorta"],"genera":["Eucalyptus"]},"PMC4150075":{"title":["Entoloma subgenus Leptonia in boreal-temperate Eurasia: towards a phylogenetic species concept."],"authors":["Morozova OV, Noordeloos ME, Vila J."],"doi":["10.3767/003158514x681774"],"abstract":["This study reveals the concordance, or lack thereof, between morphological and phylogenetic species concepts within Entoloma subg.

important for gene regulation, recombination, DNA replication, cell cycle and mismatch repair. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the SSR motif distribution in the 5'UTR, ORF and 3'UTR fractions of ESTs across selected genera of woody trees representing gymnosperms (17 species from seven genera) and angiosperms (40 species from eight genera). RESULTS: Our analysis supports a modest contribution of EST-SSR length to genome size in gymnosperms, while EST-SSR density was not associated with genome size in neither angiosperms nor gymnosperms. Multiple factors seem to have contributed to the lower abundance of EST-SSRs in gymnosperms that has resulted in a non-linear relationship with genome size diversity. The AG/CT motif was found to be the most abundant in SSRs of both angiosperms and gymnosperms, with a relative increase in AT/AT in the latter. Our data also reveals a higher abundance of hexamers across the gymnosperm genera.

Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are valuable tools in exploring general temporal trends and spatial patterns of potential range shifts. Understanding projections to future climate for tree species will facilitate policy making in forestry. Comparative studies for a large number of tree species require the availability of suitable and standardized indices. A crucial limitation when deriving such indices is the threshold problem in defining ranges, which has made interspecies comparison problematic until now. Here we propose a set of threshold-free indices, which measure range explosion (I), overlapping (O), and range center movement in three dimensions (Dx, Dy, Dz), based on fuzzy set theory (Fuzzy Set based Potential Range Shift Index, F-PRS Index). A graphical tool (PRS_Chart) was developed to visualize these indices. This technique was then applied to 46 Pinaceae species that are widely distributed and partly common in China. The spatial patterns of the modeling results were then statistically tested for significance. Results showed that range overlap was generally low; no trends in range size changes and longitudinal movements could be found, but northward and poleward movement trends were highly significant. Although range shifts seemed to exhibit huge interspecies variation, they were very consistent for certain climate change scenarios. Comparing the IPCC scenarios, we found that scenario A1B would lead to a larger extent of range shifts (less overlapping and more latitudinal movement) than the A2 and the B1 scenarios. It is expected that the newly developed standardized indices and the respective graphical tool will facilitate studies on PRS's for other tree species groups that are important in forestry as well, and thus support climate adaptive forest management."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["P. latteri","P. massoniana","P. tabulaeformis","P. koraiesis","P. sylvestris","Pinus koraiensis","Abies spectabilis","Pinus pumila","Pinus massoniana","Picea morrisonicola","Picea spinulosa"],"genera":["Cedrus","Larix","Larix","Larix","Abies","Pinus","Abies","Picea","Pinus","Abies","Larix"]},"PMC4189497":{"title":["Climatic influences on wood anatomy and tree-ring features of Great Basin conifers at a new mountain observatory."],"authors":["Ziaco E, Biondi F, Rossi S, Deslauriers A."],"abstract":["•A network of mountain observing stations has been installed in the Great Basin of North America.

Chronologies of earlywood and latewood widths, as well as cellular parameters, were developed from the year 2000 to 2012. •At the southern (drier and warmer) sites, Pinus monophylla had smaller cell lumen, tracheid diameter, and cell wall thickness. Pinus monophylla and P. flexilis showed bigger cellular elements at the higher elevations, whereas the opposite pattern was found in Picea engelmannii and Pinus longaeva. When all species and sites were pooled together, stem diameter was positively related with earlywood anatomical parameters. •We have provided a glimpse of the applications that NevCAN, as a new scientific tool, could allow in the general field of botany.

Recent studies on community genetics and ecology have suggested that genetic diversity is not completely independent of species diversity. The Mexican Picea chihuahuana Martínez is an endemic species listed as \"Endangered\" on the Red List. Forty populations of Chihuahua spruce have been identified. This species is often associated with tree species of eight genera in gallery forests. This rare Picea chihuahuana tree community covers an area no more than 300 ha and has been subject of several studies involving different topics such as ecology, genetic structure and climate change. The overall aim of these studies was to obtain a dataset for developing management tools to help decision makers implement preservation and conservation strategies. However, this unique forest tree community may also represent an excellent subject for helping us to understand the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes in determining community structure and dynamics. The AFLP technique and species composition data were used together to test the hypothesis that species diversity is related to the adaptive genetic structure of some dominant tree species (Picea chihuahuana, Pinus strobiformis, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Populus tremuloides) of the Picea chihuahuana tree community at fourteen locations. The Hill numbers were used as a diversity measure. The results revealed a significant correlation between tree species diversity and genetic structure in Populus tremuloides. Because the relationship between the two levels of diversity was found to be positive for the putative adaptive AFLP detected, genetic and species structures of the tree community were possibly simultaneously adapted to a combination of ecological or environmental factors. The present findings indicate that interactions between genetic variants and species diversity may be crucial in shaping tree communities."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Pinus strobiformis","Pseudotsuga menziesii","Populus tremuloides","Picea chihuahuana","Populus tremuloides","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Pinus strobiformis","Pseudotsuga menziesii","Populus tremuloides","Picea chihuahuana","Pinus strobiformis","Pseudotsuga menziesii","Populus tremuloides","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Pinus strobiformis","Pseudotsuga menziesii","Populus tremuloides","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Pseudotsuga menziesii","Pinus strobiformis","Populus tremuloides","Populus tremuloides","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Pinus strobiformis","Pseudotsuga menziesii","Populus tremuloides","Picea chihuahuana","Populus tremuloides","Pinus strobiformis","Pseudotsuga menziesii","Picea chihuahuana","Pinus strobiformis","Pseudotsuga menziesii","Populus tremuloides","Populus tremuloides","Populus tremuloides","Populus tremuloides","Picea chihuahuana","Pseudotsuga menziesii","Populus tremuloides","Populus tremuloides","Populus tremuloides","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Quercus petraea","Quercus robur","Picea abies","Fagus sylvatica","Pinus monticola","Populus tremuloides","Picea chihuahuana","Populus tremuloides","Populus tremuloides","Populus tremuloides","Populus tremuloides","Populus tremuloides","Populus tremuloides","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana"],"genera":["Cupressus","Picea","Pinus","Pseudotsuga","Populus"]},"PMC4233402":{"title":["A taxonomic monograph of Nearctic Scolytus Geoffroy (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Scolytinae)."],"authors":["Smith SM, Cognato AI."],"doi":["10.3897/zookeys.450.7452"],"abstract":["The Nearctic bark beetle genus Scolytus Geoffroy was revised based in part on a molecular and morphological phylogeny.

woody plant species, summarizes data on their frost resistance, highlights the importance of freeze avoidance mechanisms, and indicates areas of future research. Freezing temperatures are possible throughout the whole growing period in the alpine life zone. Frost severity, comprised of both intensity and duration, becomes greater with increasing elevation and, there is also a greater probability, that small statured woody plants, may be insulated by snow cover. Several frost survival mechanisms have evolved in woody alpine plants in response to these environmental conditions. Examples of tolerance to extracellular freezing and freeze dehydration, life cycles that allow species to escape frost, and freeze avoidance mechanisms can all be found. Despite their specific adaption to the alpine environment, frost damage can occur in spring, while all alpine woody plants have a low risk of frost damage in winter. Experimental evidence indicates that premature deacclimation in Pinus cembra in the spring, and a limited ability of many species of alpine woody shrubs to rapidly reacclimate when they lose snow cover, resulting in reduced levels of frost resistance in the spring, may be particularly critical under the projected changes in climate. In this review, frost resistance and specific frost survival mechanisms of different organs (leaves, stems, vegetative and reproductive over-wintering buds, flowers, and fruits) and tissues are compared. The seasonal dynamics of frost resistance of leaves of trees, as opposed to woody shrubs, is also discussed. The ability of some tissues and organs to avoid freezing by supercooling, as visualized by high resolution infrared thermography, are also provided. Collectively, the report provides a review of the complex and diverse ways that woody plants survive in the frost dominated environment of the alpine life zone."],"journal":"Frontiers in plant science","species":["Pinus cembra","Betula pubescens","Rhododendron ferrugineum","Ranunculus glacialis","Rhododendron ferrugineum","Loiseleuria procumbens","Rhododendron ferrugineum","Loiseleuria procumbens","Calluna vulgaris","Empetrum hermaphroditum","Loiseleuria procumbens","Rhododendron ferrugineum","Rhododendron ferrugineum","Abies homolepis","Abies balsamea","Pinus cembra","Pinus mugo","Pinus abies","Loiseleuria decidua","Acer japonicum","Pyrus syriaca","Rhododendron ferrugineum","V. myrtillus","V. myrtillus","Vaccinium myrtillus","Pinus cembra","Rhododendron ferrugineum","Picea abies","Pinus cembra","Sorbus aucuparia","Larix decidua","Pinus cembra","Pinus cembra","Pinus mugo","Rhododendron ferrugineum","Picea abies","Pinus cembra","Pinus abies","Pinus cembra","Rhododendron ferrugineum","Picea abies","Pinus cembra","Picea abies","Pinus cembra","Pinus mugo","Rhododendron ferrugineum","Loiseleuria procumbens","Calluna vulgaris","Rhododendron ferrugineum","Pinus abies","Rhododendron ferrugineum","Vaccinium myrtillus","Vaccinium uliginosum","Pinus cembra","Picea rubens","Pinus sylvestris","Vaccinium myrtillus","Betula pubescens","Pinus cembra","Pinus cembra","Pinus cembra"],"genera":["Larix"]},"PMC4249817":{"title":["Do differences in chemical composition of stem and cap of Amanita muscaria fruiting bodies correlate with topsoil type?"],"authors":["Deja S, Wieczorek PP, Halama M, Jasicka-Misiak I, Kafarski P, Poliwoda A, Młynarz P."],"doi":["10.1371/journal.pone.0104084"],"abstract":["Fly agaric (Amanita muscaria) was investigated using a 1H NMR-based metabolomics approach.

Conversely, they exhibited lower concentrations of formate, fumarate, trehalose, α- and β-glucose. Six metabolites, malate, succinate, gluconate, N-acetylated compounds (NAC), tyrosine and phenylalanine, were detected in whole A. muscaria fruiting bodies but did not show significant differences in their levels between caps and stems (P value>0.05 and/or OPLS-DA loading correlation coefficient <0.4). This methodology allowed for the differentiation between the fruiting bodies of A. muscaria from mineral and mineral-organic topsoil. Moreover, the metabolomic approach and multivariate tools enabled to ascribe the basidiomata of fly agaric to the type of topsoil.

Thus, dehydrins from angiosperms present different repetitions of the segments Y, S, and K, while gymnosperm dehydrins show A, E, S, and K segments. The only fragment present in all the dehydrins described to date is the K-segment. Different works suggest the K-segment is involved in key protective functions during dehydration stress, mainly stabilizing membranes. In this work, we describe for the first time two Pinus pinaster proteins with truncated K-segments and a third one completely lacking K-segments, but whose sequence homology leads us to consider them still as dehydrins. qRT-PCR expression analysis show a significant induction of these dehydrins during a severe and prolonged drought stress. By in silico analysis we confirmed the presence of these dehydrins in other Pinaceae species, breaking the convention regarding the compulsory presence of K-segments in these proteins.

The purpose of the study was to examine metabolism in conifers under forced deacclimation (artificially induced spring) by exposing shoots of Picea abies (boreal species) and Abies alba (temperate species) to a greenhouse environment (22°C, 16/8 h D/N cycle) over a 9 weeks period. Each week, we scored bud opening and collected samples for GC/MS-based metabolite profiling. We detected a total of 169 assigned metabolites and 80 identified metabolites, comprising compounds such as mono- and disaccharides, Krebs cycle acids, amino acids, polyols, phenolics, and phosphorylated structures. Untargeted multivariate statistical analysis based on PCA and cluster analysis segregated samples by species, tissue type, and stage of tissue deacclimations. Similar patterns of metabolic regulation in both species were observed in buds (amino acids, Krebs cycle acids) and needles (hexoses, pentoses, and Krebs cycle acids). Based on correlation of bud opening score with compound levels, distinct metabolites could be associated with bud and shoot development, including amino acids, sugars, and acids with known osmolyte function, and secondary metabolites. This study has shed light on how elevated temperature affects metabolism in buds and needles of conifer species during the deacclimation phase, and contributes to the discussion about how phenological characters in conifers may respond to future global warming."],"journal":"Frontiers in plant science","species":["Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea sitchensis","Picea obovata","Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Abies alba","Abies alba","Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Picea abies","Abies alba","Abies alba","Picea abies","Abies abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Abies alba","Abies alba","Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea abies","Abies alba","Eucalyptus pauciflora","Abies alba","Picea abies","Pinus sylvestris","Abies alba","Picea abies","Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Arabidopsis thaliana","Abies alba","Picea abies","Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Picea obovata","Picea sitchensis","Picea abies","Abies alba","Picea abies","Picea abies","Abies alba"],"genera":[]},"PMC4302573":{"title":["The GRAS gene family in pine: transcript expression patterns associated with the maturation-related decline of competence to form adventitious roots."],"authors":["Abarca D, Pizarro A, Hernández I, Sánchez C, Solana SP, Del Amo A, Carneros E, Díaz-Sala C."],"doi":["10.1186/s12870-014-0354-8"],"abstract":["Adventitious rooting is an organogenic process by which roots are induced from differentiated cells other than those specified to develop roots.

Comparative analyses of protein structures showed that pine GRAS members are conserved compared with their relatives in angiosperms. Relatively high GRAS mRNA levels were measured in non-differentiated proliferating embryogenic cultures and during embryo development. The mRNA levels of putative GRAS family transcription factors, including Pinus radiata's SCARECROW (SCR), PrSCR, and SCARECROW-LIKE (SCL) 6, PrSCL6, were significantly reduced or non-existent in adult tissues that no longer had the capacity to form adventitious roots, but were maintained or induced after the reprogramming of adult cells in rooting-competent tissues.

They show a wide range of bioactivities including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immuno-enhancing effects. Their secondary metabolites have been the focus of many studies, but the importance of fungal strain for bioactivity and metabolite production has not been investigated so far for these Basidiomycetes. Therefore, we screened several strains from three medicinal polypore species from traditional European medicine: Fomes fomentarius, Fomitopsis pinicola and Piptoporus betulinus. A total of 22 strains were compared concerning their growth rates, optimum growth temperatures, as well as antimicrobial and antifungal properties of ethanolic fruit body extracts. The morphological identification of strains was confirmed based on rDNA ITS phylogenetic analyses. Our results showed that species delimitation is critical due to the presence of several distinct lineages, e.g. within the Fomes fomentarius species complex. Fungal strains within one lineage showed distinct differences in optimum growth temperatures, in secondary metabolite production, and accordingly, in their bioactivities. In general, F. pinicola and P. betulinus extracts exerted distinct antibiotic activities against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus at minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 31-125 μg mL(-1); The antifungal activities of all three polypores against Aspergillus flavus, A. fumigatus, Absidia orchidis and Candida krusei were often strain-specific, ranging from 125-1000 μg mL(-1). Our results highlight that a reliable species identification, followed by an extensive screening for a 'best strain' is an essential prerequisite for the proper identification of bioactive material."],"journal":"AMB Express","species":["Fomes fomentarius","Fomes pinicola","P. betulinus","Bacillus subtilis","Staphylococcus aureus","Candida krusei","Fusarium avenaceum","Laetiporus sulphureus","Laricifomes officinalis","P. betulinus","Fomes pinicola","P. betulinus","Escherichia coli","Staphylococcus aureus","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Bacillus subtilis","Candida krusei","A. fumigatus","Candida krusei","Candida krusei","Fomes pinicola","Fomes fomentarius","Abies alba","Betula pubescens","Fomes fomentarius","Fomes pinicola","Fomes fomentarius","Staphylococcus aureus","Abies fumigatus","Abies orchidis","Fagus sylvatica","Abies orchidis","Bacillus subtilis","Staphylococcus aureus","Candida kruseii","Trichophyton sp","Candida krusei","Fomes pinicola","Bacillus subtilis","Fomes pinicola","Absidia orchidis","Abies flavus","Picea abies","Pseudomonas betulinus","Bacillus subtilis","Staphylococcus aureus","Absidia orchidis","Abies fumigatus","Fomes fomentarius","Fomes sylvatica","Q. pubescens","Fomes fomentarius","Fomes pinicola","Fomes pinicola","Pseudomonas betulinus","Pseudomonas betulinus","Fomes fomentarius","Fomes fomentarius","Fomes fasciatus","Fomes fomentarius","Fomes fomentarius","Acer negundo","Pseudomonas abies","Fomes fomentarius","Fomes fomentarius","Fomes fomentarius","Fomes fomentarius","Fomes fomentarius","Fomes fasciatus","Fomes pinicola","Fomes ochracea","Fomes pinicola","Fomes pinicola","Pseudomonas betulinus","Acer saccharum","Pseudomonas betulinus","Pseudomonas soloniensis","Pseudomonas betulinus","Fomes fomentarius","Fomes pinicola","G. lucidum","Inonotus obliquus","Fomes fomentarius","Fomes pinicola","Pseudomonas betulinus","Fomes pinicola","Staphylococcus aureus","Absidia orchidis","Bacillus subtilis","Candida krusei","Fomes pinicola","Bacillus subtilis","Fomes pinicola","Bacillus cereus","Pseudomonas betulinus","Pseudomonas betulinus","Staphylococcus aureus","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Escherichia coli","Pseudomonas betulinus","Fomes pinicola","Pseudomonas betulinus","Fomes fomentarius","Fomes fomentarius","Fomes fomentarius","Fomes fomentarius","Ganoderma lucidum"],"genera":["Agaricomycetes","Picea","Fagus","Quercus","Picea","Alnus","Larix","Fomitopsis","Fagus","Picea","Quercus","Fomes"]},"PMC4307349":{"title":["Variation and genetic structure in Platanus mexicana (Platanaceae) along riparian altitudinal gradient."],"authors":["Galván-Hernández DM, Lozada-García JA, Flores-Estévez N, Galindo-González J, Vázquez-Torres SM."],"doi":["10.3390/ijms16012066"],"abstract":["Platanus mexicana is a dominant arboreal species of riparian ecosystems. These ecosystems are associated with altitudinal gradients that can generate genetic differences in the species, especially in the extremes of the distribution. However, studies on the altitudinal effect on genetic variation to riparian species are scarce. In Mexico, the population of P. mexicana along the Colipa River (Veracruz State) grows below its reported minimum altitude range, possibly the lowest where this tree grows. This suggests that altitude might be an important factor in population genetics differentiation. We examined the genetic variation and population structuring at four sites with different altitudes (70, 200, 600 and 1700 m a.s.l.) using ten inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers. The highest value for Shannon index and Nei's gene diversity was obtained at 1700 m a.s.l. (He = 0.27, Ne = 1.47, I = 0.42) and polymorphism reached the top value at the middle altitude (% p = 88.57). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and STRUCTURE analysis indicated intrapopulation genetic differentiation. The arithmetic average (UPGMA) dendrogram identified 70 m a.s.l. as the most genetically distant site. The genetic structuring resulted from limited gene flow and genetic drift. This is the first report of genetic variation in populations of P. mexicana in Mexico. This research highlights its importance as a dominant species, and its ecological and evolutionary implications in altitudinal gradients of riparian ecosystems."],"journal":"International journal of molecular sciences","species":["Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Fraxinus mandshurica","Euptelea pleiospermum","Myricaria laxiflora","Pinus hartwegii","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Fraxinus mandshurica","Pinus oocarpa","Quercus serrata","Larix kaempferi","Picea abies","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Myricaria laxiflora","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Picea glehnii","Platanus mexicana","Pinus hartwegii","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana","Platanus mexicana"],"genera":[]},"PMC4310600":{"title":["Evidence of tree species' range shifts in a complex landscape."],"authors":["Monleon VJ, Lintz HE."],"doi":["10.1371/journal.pone.0118069"],"abstract":["Climate change is expected to change the distribution of species. For long-lived, sessile species such as trees, tracking the warming climate depends on seedling colonization of newly favorable areas. We compare the distribution of seedlings and mature trees for all but the rarest tree species in California, Oregon and Washington, United States of America, a large, environmentally diverse region. Across 46 species, the mean annual temperature of the range of seedlings was 0.120°C colder than that of the range of trees (95% confidence interval from 0.096 to 0.144°C). The extremes of the seedling distributions also shifted towards colder temperature than those of mature trees, but the change was less pronounced. Although the mean elevation and mean latitude of the range of seedlings was higher than and north of those of the range of mature trees, elevational and latitudinal shifts run in opposite directions for the majority of the species, reflecting the lack of a direct biological relationship between species' distributions and those variables. The broad scale, environmental diversity and variety of disturbance regimes and land uses of the study area, the large number and exhaustive sampling of tree species, and the direct causal relationship between the temperature response and a warming climate, provide strong evidence to attribute the observed shifts to climate change."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["Pinus monophylla","Acer glabrum","Cercocarpus ledifolius","Acer negundo","Alnus rhombifolia","Betula occidentalis","Betula papyrifera","Hesperocyparis bakeri","Hesperocyparis forbesii","Hesperocyparis macrocarpa","Hesperocyparis sargentii","Juniperus californica","Juniperus osteosperma","Juniperus scopulorum","Sequoiadendron giganteum","Olneya tesota","Prosopis glandulosa","Prosopis pubescens","Quercus engelmanii","Quercus lobata","Juglans californica","Juglans hindsii","Larix lyallii","Picea breweriana","Pinus attenuata","Pinus balfouriana","Pinus coulteri","Pinus flexilis","Pinus longaeva","Pinus muricata","Pinus radiata","Pinus washoensis","Pseudotsuga macrocarpa","Platanus racemosa","Malus fusca","Prunus emarginata","Prunus virginiana","Populus fremontii","Torreya californica","Prunus emarginata","Calocedrus decurrens","Pinus monticola","Cornus nuttallii","Pinus monticola","Pinus albicaulis","Calocedrus decurrens","Cornus nuttallii","Pinus albicaulis","Pinus lambertiana","Pinus jeffreyi","Calocedrus decurrens","Abies concolor","Pinus albicaulis","Tsuga heterophylla","Pinus monticola","Cornus nuttallii","Cronartium ribicola","Discula destructiva","Pinus monticola","Pinus albicaulis","Tsuga heterophylla","Pinus monticola","Cornus nuttallii"],"genera":[]},"PMC4312774":{"title":["Static and dynamic bending has minor effects on xylem hydraulics of conifer branches (Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris)."],"authors":["Mayr S, Bertel C, Dämon B, Beikircher B."],"doi":["10.1111/pce.12307"],"abstract":["The xylem hydraulic efficiency and safety is usually measured on mechanically unstressed samples, although trees may be exposed to combined hydraulic and mechanical stress in the field. We analysed changes in hydraulic conductivity and vulnerability to drought-induced embolism during static bending of Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris branches as well as the effect of dynamic bending on the vulnerability. We hypothesized this mechanical stress to substantially impair xylem hydraulics. Intense static bending caused an only small decrease in hydraulic conductance (-19.5 ± 2.4% in P. abies) but no shift in vulnerability thresholds. Dynamic bending caused a 0.4 and 0.8 MPa decrease of the water potential at 50 and 88% loss of conductivity in P. sylvestris, but did not affect vulnerability thresholds in P. abies. With respect to applied extreme bending radii, effects on plant hydraulics were surprisingly small and are thus probably of minor eco-physiological importance. More importantly, results indicate that available xylem hydraulic analyses (of conifers) sufficiently reflect plant hydraulics under field conditions."],"journal":"Plant, cell & environment","species":["Pseudotsuga menziesii","Pinus taeda","Pinus contorta","Picea abies","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus strobus"],"genera":["Malus","Picea"]},"PMC4312940":{"title":["The largest type study of Agaricales species to date: bringing identification and nomenclature of Phlegmacium (Cortinarius) into the DNA era."],"authors":["Liimatainen K, Niskanen T, Dima B, Kytövuori I, Ammirati JF, Frøslev TG."],"doi":["10.3767/003158514x684681"],"abstract":["Cortinarius is a species-rich and morphologically challenging genus with a cosmopolitan distribution.

Our goals for this project were to: i) study type material to determine which species already have been described; ii) stabilize the use of Friesian and other older names by choosing a neo- or epitype; iii) describe new species that were discovered during the process of studying specimens; and iv) establish an accurate ITS barcoding database for Phlegmacium species. A total of 236 types representing 154 species were studied. Of these 114 species are described only once whereas 40 species had one ore more synonyms. Of the names studied only 61 were currently represented in GenBank. Neotypes are proposed for 21 species, and epitypes are designated for three species.

We established rain-out shelters to induce both severe (two full-cover plots) and moderate (two semi-cover plots) drought stress. In total, 18 sample trees, which were divided equally between the above treatment plots and two control plots, were investigated. Infestation was controlled experimentally using a novel 'attack box' method. Treatments influenced the ratios of successful and defended attacks, but predisposition of trees to infestation appeared to be mainly driven by variations in stress status of the individual trees over time. With increasingly negative twig water potentials and decreasing resin exudation, the defence capability of the spruce trees decreased. We provide empirical evidence that water-limiting conditions impair Norway spruce resistance to bark beetle attack.

Based on these results, Ceuthospora is reduced to synonymy under the older generic name Phacidium. Phacidiaceae (currently Helotiales) is suggested to constitute a separate order, Phacidiales (Leotiomycetes), as sister to Helotiales, which is clearly paraphyletic. Phacidiaceae includes Bulgaria, and consequently the family Bulgariaceae becomes a synonym of Phacidiaceae.

Results indicate that all species were undergoing water limitations as measured by increasing ΔW throughout the growing season, whereby P. abies most strongly drew upon water reserves in the living tissues of the bark. Quite similar ΔW developed in drought-sensitive L. decidua and drought-tolerant P. sylvestris indicate that various water storage locations are depleted in species showing different strategies of water status regulation, i.e. anisohydric vs. isohydric behavior, respectively, and/or water uptake efficiency differs among these species.

Stable isotope ratios in plants are known to reflect geographical variations. In this study we analysed four stable isotope ratios in order to develop a model able to identify the geographic origin of Norway spruce in the European Alps.δ18O, δ2H, δ13C and δ15N were measured in bulk needles of Picea abies sampled in 20 sites in and around the European Alps. Environmental and spatial variables were found to be related to the measured isotope ratios. An ordinary least squares regression was used to identify the most important factor in stable isotope variability in bulk needles. Spatial autocorrelation was tested for all isotope ratios by means of Moran's I. δ18O, δ2H and δ15N values differed significantly between sites. Distance from the coast had the greatest influence on δ2H, while latitude and longitude were strongly related to δ18O. δ13C values did not appear to have any relationship with geographical position, while δ15N values were influenced by distance from the motorway. The regression model improved the explanatory power of the spatial and environmental variables. Positive spatial autocorrelations were found for δ18O and δ2H values.The δ 18O, δ2H and δ15N values in P. abies bulk needles are a suitable proxy to identify geographic origin as they vary according to geographical position.

In addition, they may entail other damages, such as desiccation of the exposed internal parts, or become a gateway to infection by fungi and other pathogens. To successfully overcome such injuries, plants must reorganize their meristems or even differentiate new ones, producing new traumatic tissues to cover the wound and restore the vascular connection.In this work we analyse the anatomical growth response in conifers after debarking and injuring the vascular cambium, using Pinus canariensis as model species, due to its high wound recovery ability. Conversely to angiosperm woody species, this process is initiated and largely driven by the damaged vascular cambium and not by proliferation in the wound surface. We have detected alterations and switches in the divisions of cambial cells, associated to their position relative to the surface and edges of the wound, resulting in disordered traumatic xylem. We also describe the formation of column-like structures, after girdling, which are in part formed by the proliferation of xylem parenchymatous cells, associated to axial resin ducts.Abundant resinosis on the wound surface, typical of conifers, is an efficient barrier against opportunistic fungi, insects, etc. but it also hinders the healing process directly from the surface. Thus, wound closure must be largely carried out from the wound margins, being a much slower process, which very often remains unconcluded for long years. This work also describes for the first time the proliferation of inner parenchymatous cells to form column-like structures, which accelerates wound closure in girdled P. canariensis. Irregularities in the surface of the healing edge or column-like structures result in the production of disordered vascular tissues, compromising their future functionality, and which must be overcome through the fast restoration of the proper polarity in vascular cambium."],"journal":"BMC plant biology","species":["Pinus canariensis","Eucommia ulmoides","Populus tomentosa","Pinus pinaster","Pinus ponderosa","Picea abies","Pinus canariensis","Pinus canariensis","Metasequoia glyptostroboides","Pinus canariensis","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus canariensis","Pinus canariensis","Populus tomentosa","Pinus nigra","Picea abies","Larix decidua","Cedrus libani","Populus tomentosa","Eucommia ulmoides","Pinus canariensis","Pinus canariensis","Pinus canariensis","Pinus taeda","Pinus strobus","Pinus canariensis","Pinus sylvestris","Pseudotsuga menziensii","Pinus canariensis"],"genera":["Picea"]},"PMC4355648":{"title":["Additions to the myxobiota of the Aland Islands."],"authors":["Kunttu P, Varis E, Kunttu SM."],"doi":["10.3897/bdj.3.e4653"],"abstract":["Six myxomycete species new to the Åland Islands are presented: Comatrichaelegans, Cribrariaintricata, Didymiumminus, Hemitrichiaclavata, Liceavariabilis and Trichiafavoginea.

At the scale of small-size trees, crown traits related to structural geometry of branching pattern and space occupancy through phyllotaxis can be accurately evaluated in 3D, using computed tomography (CT) scanning data. We demonstrate this by scrutinizing the crowns of 15 potted miniature conifers of different species or varieties, classified in two groups based on leaf type (10 needlelike, 5 scalelike); we also test whether mean values of crown traits measured from CT scanning data and correlations with a shade tolerance index (STI) differ between groups. Seven crown traits, including fractal dimensions (FD1: smaller scales, FD2: larger scales) and leaf areas, were evaluated for all 15 miniature conifers; an average silhouette-to-total-area ratio was also calculated for each of the 10 needlelike-leaf conifers. Between-group differences in mean values are significant (P < 0.05) for STI, FD1, FD2, and the average leaf area displayed (ĀD). Between-group differences in sign and strength of correlations are observed. For example, the correlation between STI and FD1 is negative and significant (P < 0.10) for the needlelike-leaf group, but is positive and significant (P < 0.05) for the miniature conifers with scalelike leaves, which had lower STI and higher FD1 on average in our study; the positive correlation between STI and ĀD is significant (P < 0.05) for the scalelike-leaf group, and very moderate for the needlelike-leaf one.

Genetic structure among 107 populations (mtDNA data) and 75 populations (cpDNA data) was analyzed using Bayesian and genetic distance approaches. Population differentiation was high for mtDNA (dispersed by seeds only), but also for cpDNA (dispersed by seeds and pollen), indicating that pollen gene flow is more restricted in balsam fir than in other boreal conifers. Low cpDNA gene flow in balsam fir may relate to low pollen production due to the inherent biology of the species and populations being decimated by recurrent spruce budworm epidemics, and/or to low dispersal of pollen grains due to their peculiar structural properties. Accordingly, a phylogeographic structure was detected using both mtDNA and cpDNA markers and population structure analyses supported the existence of at least five genetically distinct glacial lineages in central and eastern North America. Four of these would originate from glacial refugia located south of the Laurentide ice sheet, while the last one would have persisted in the northern Labrador region. As expected due to reduced pollen-mediated gene flow, congruence between the geographic distribution of mtDNA and cpDNA lineages was higher than in other North American conifers. However, concordance was not complete, reflecting that restricted but nonetheless detectable cpDNA gene flow among glacial lineages occurred during the Holocene.

Seedlings were grown at moderate (25°C/15°C) and high (35°C/25°C) day/night temperatures, for four months. The approximated biomass increment (ΔD2H) for all taxa decreased under high temperature stress, associated with decreased photosynthesis and increased respiration. However, the two alpine taxa exhibited lower photosynthetic acclimation and higher respiratory acclimation than either lowland taxon. Moreover, higher leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA) and leaf nitrogen content per unit area (Narea), and a smaller change in the nitrogen use efficiency of photosynthesis (PNUE) for lowland taxa indicated that these maintained higher homeostasis of photosynthesis than alpine taxa. The higher respiration rates produced more energy for repair and maintenance biomass, especially for higher photosynthetic activity for lowland taxa, which causes lower respiratory acclimation. Thus, the changes of ΔD2H for alpine spruces were larger than that for lowland spruces. These results indicate that long term heat stress negatively impact on the growth of Picea seedlings, and alpine taxa are more affected than low altitude ones by high temperature stress.

The PAC species Acephala applanata simultaneously formed structures resembling ericoid mycorrhiza (ErM) and DSE microsclerotia in blueberry. A. macrosclerotiorum, a close relative to PAC, formed ectomycorrhizae with spruce but not with birch, and structures resembling ErM in blueberry. Phialocephala glacialis, another close relative to PAC, formed structures resembling ErM in blueberry. In blueberry, six PAC strains significantly decreased dry shoot biomass compared to ErM control. In birch, one A. macrosclerotiorum strain increased root biomass and the other shoot biomass in comparison with non-inoculated control. The dual mycorrhizal ability of A. macrosclerotiorum suggested that it may form mycorrhizal links between Ericaceae and Pinaceae. However, we were unable to detect this species in Ericaceae roots growing in a forest with presence of A. macrosclerotiorum ectomycorrhizae. Nevertheless, the diversity of Ericaceae mycobionts was high (380 OTUs) with individual sites often dominated by hitherto unreported helotialean and chaetothyrialean/verrucarialean species; in contrast, typical ErM fungi were either absent or low in abundance. Some DSE apparently have a potential to form mycorrhizae with typical middle European forest plants. However, except A. applanata, the tested representatives of all hitherto described PAC cryptic species formed typical DSE colonization without specific structures necessary for mycorrhizal nutrient transport.

Candidate genes offer a valuable tool to reduce the complexity of the analysis and the amount of sequencing work and costs. For this study we combined an improved drought stress phenotyping of needles via a novel terahertz water monitoring technique with Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends to identify candidate genes for drought stress response in European silver fir (Abies alba Mill.). A pooled cDNA library was constructed from the cotyledons of six drought stressed and six well-watered silver fir seedlings, respectively. Differential expression analyses of these libraries revealed 296 candidate genes for drought stress response in silver fir (247 up- and 49 down-regulated) of which a subset was validated by RT-qPCR of the twelve individual cotyledons. A majority of these genes code for currently uncharacterized proteins and hint on new genomic resources to be explored in conifers. Furthermore, we could show that some traditional reference genes from model plant species (GAPDH and eIF4A2) are not suitable for differential analysis and we propose a new reference gene, TPC1, for drought stress expression profiling in needles of conifer seedlings."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["Abies alba","Abies alba","Abies alba","Abies alba","Abies alba","Abies alba","Triticum aestivum","Triticum aestivum","Pinus pinaster","Picea abies","Pinus pinaster","Abies alba","Pinus taeda","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinaster","Pinus halepensis","Picea sitchensis","Abies alba"],"genera":["Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis"]},"PMC4415794":{"title":["Community Structure and Survival of Tertiary Relict Thuja sutchuenensis (Cupressaceae) in the Subtropical Daba Mountains, Southwestern China."],"authors":["Tang CQ, Yang Y, Ohsawa M, Momohara A, Yi SR, Robertson K, Song K, Zhang SQ, He LY."],"doi":["10.1371/journal.pone.0125307"],"abstract":["A rare coniferous Tertiary relict tree species, Thuja sutchuenensis Franch, has survived in the Daba Mountains of southwestern China.

In this study, we examine the evidence for expression-mediated selection in the first two fully sequenced representatives of the gymnosperm plant clade (Picea abies and Picea glauca). We use genome-wide estimates of gene expression (>50,000 expressed genes) to study the relationship between gene expression, codon bias, rates of sequence divergence, protein length, and gene duplication. We found that gene expression is correlated with rates of sequence divergence and codon bias, suggesting that natural selection is acting on Picea protein-coding genes for translational efficiency. Gene expression, rates of sequence divergence, and codon bias are correlated with the size of gene families, with large multicopy gene families having, on average, a lower expression level and breadth, lower codon bias, and higher rates of sequence divergence than single-copy gene families. Tissue-specific patterns of gene expression were more common in large gene families with large gene expression divergence than in single-copy families. Recent family expansions combined with large gene expression variation in paralogs and increased rates of sequence evolution suggest that some Picea gene families are rapidly evolving to cope with biotic and abiotic stress.

As such, species of the Ericaceae family have a major effect on the regeneration of tree species in boreal ecosystems. It is thus imperative to understand the ecological gradients controlling their distribution and abundance, so that their impacts can be taken into account in sustainable forest management. Using innovative analytical techniques from landscape ecology, we aimed to position, along ecological gradients, four Ericaceae found in the boreal forest of Quebec (Canada) (Rhododendron groenlandicum, Kalmia angustifolia, Chamaedaphne calyculata, and Vaccinium spp), to regionalize these species into landscape units relevant to forest management, and to estimate the relative importance of several ecological drivers (climate, disturbances, stand attributes, and physical environment) that control the species distribution and abundance. We conducted our study in boreal Quebec, over a study area covering 535,355 km(2). We used data from 15,339 ecological survey plots and forest maps to characterize 1422 ecological districts covering the study region. We evaluated the relative proportion of each ericaceous species and explanatory variables at the district level. Vegetation and explanatory variables matrices were used to conduct redundancy, cluster, and variation partitioning analyses. We observed that ericaceous species are mainly distributed in the western part of the study area and each species has a distinct latitudinal and longitudinal gradient distribution. On the basis of these gradients, we delimited 10 homogeneous landscape units distinct in terms of ericaceous species abundance and environmental drivers. The distribution of the ericaceous species along ecological gradients is closely related to the overlaps between the four sets of explanatory variables considered.

To address these objectives we wounded or inoculated 30-year-old Norway spruce clones with H. annosum and 454-sequenced the transcriptome of the interaction at 0, 5 and 15 days post inoculation.

Three delta-12 fatty acid desaturase transcripts and one Clavaminate synthase-like transcript, both associated with virulence in other pathosystems, were found among the significantly induced transcripts. The analysis of the Norway spruce transcriptional responses produced a handful of differentially expressed transcripts. Most of these transcripts originated from genes known to respond to H. annosum. However, three genes that had not previously been reported to respond to H. annosum showed specific induction to inoculation: an oxophytodienoic acid-reductase (OPR), a beta-glucosidase and a germin-like protein (GLP2) gene. Even in a small data set like ours, five novel highly expressed Norway spruce transcripts without significant alignment to any previously annotated protein in Genbank but present in the P. abies (v1.0) gene catalogue were identified.

Forest managers need growth and yield models that can be used to predict future forest dynamics during the transition period of present-day forests under a changing climatic regime. In this study, we developed a forest growth and yield model that can be used to predict individual-tree growth under current and projected future climatic conditions. The model was constructed by integrating historical tree growth records with predictions from an ecological process-based model using neural networks. The new model predicts basal area (BA) and volume growth for individual trees in pure or mixed species forests. For model development, tree-growth data under current climatic conditions were obtained using over 3000 permanent sample plots from the Province of Nova Scotia, Canada. Data to reflect tree growth under a changing climatic regime were projected with JABOWA-3 (an ecological process-based model). Model validation with designated data produced model efficiencies of 0.82 and 0.89 in predicting individual-tree BA and volume growth. Model efficiency is a relative index of model performance, where 1 indicates an ideal fit, while values lower than zero means the predictions are no better than the average of the observations. Overall mean prediction error (BIAS) of basal area and volume growth predictions was nominal (i.e., for BA: -0.0177 cm(2) 5-year(-1) and volume: 0.0008 m(3) 5-year(-1)). Model variability described by root mean squared error (RMSE) in basal area prediction was 40.53 cm(2) 5-year(-1) and 0.0393 m(3) 5-year(-1) in volume prediction. The new modelling approach has potential to reduce uncertainties in growth and yield predictions under different climate change scenarios. This novel approach provides an avenue for forest managers to generate required information for the management of forests in transitional periods of climate change.

In this study, 3-year-old Norway spruce clones were illuminated for 12 h after sunset under blue or red light-emitting diode (LED) light for 90 d, and stem increments and other growth traits were determined. Endogenous hormone levels and transcriptome differences in the current needles were assessed to identify genes related to the red and blue light regulatory responses. The results showed that the stem increment and gibberellin (GA) levels of the seedlings illuminated by red light were 8.6% and 29.0% higher, respectively, than those of the seedlings illuminated by blue light. The indoleacetic acid (IAA) level of the seedlings illuminated by red light was 54.6% lower than that of the seedlings illuminated by blue light, and there were no significant differences in abscisic acid (ABA) or zeatin riboside [ZR] between the two groups of seedlings. The transcriptome results revealed 58,736,166 and 60,555,192 clean reads for the blue-light- and red-light-illuminated samples, respectively. Illumina sequencing revealed 21,923 unigenes, and 2744 (approximately 93.8%) out of 2926 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found to be upregulated under blue light. The main KEGG classifications of the DEGs were metabolic pathway (29%), biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (20.49%) and hormone signal transduction (8.39%). With regard to hormone signal transduction, AUXIN-RESISTANT1 (AUX1), AUX/IAA genes, auxin-inducible genes, and early auxin-responsive genes [(auxin response factor (ARF) and small auxin-up RNA (SAUR)] were all upregulated under blue light compared with red light, which might have yielded the higher IAA level. DELLA and phytochrome-interacting factor 3 (PIF3), involved in negative GA signaling, were also upregulated under blue light, which may be related to the lower GA level. Light quality also affects endogenous hormones by influencing secondary metabolism. Blue light promoted phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis and flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, accompanied by upregulation of most of the genes in their pathways. In conclusion, red light may promote stem growth by regulating biosynthesis of GAs, and blue light may promote flavonoid, lignin, phenylpropanoid and some hormones (such as jasmonic acid) which were related to plant defense in Norway spruce, which might reduce the primary metabolites available for plant growth."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["Betula pendula","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus abies","Pinus abies","Pinus abies","Pinus abies","Pinus abies","Pinus abies","Saccharina japonica","Saccharina japonica","Physcomitrella patens","Arabidopsis thaliana","Lactuca sativa","Saccharina japonica","Picea glauca"],"genera":["Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis"]},"PMC4523770":{"title":["Distribution of millipedes along an altitudinal gradient in the south of Lake Teletskoye, Altai Mts, Russia (Diplopoda)."],"authors":["Nefedieva JS, Nefediev PS, Sakhnevich MB, Dyachkov YV."],"doi":["10.3897/zookeys.510.8855"],"abstract":["The distribution of millipedes along an altitudinal gradient in the south of Lake Teletskoye, Altai, Russia based on new samples from the Kyga Profile sites, as well as on partly published and freshly revised material (Mikhaljova et al. 2007, 2008, 2014, Nefedieva and Nefediev 2008, Nefediev and Nefedieva 2013, Nefedieva et al. 2014), is established.

The consensus genetic map was used to compare the genome-wide linkage disequilibrium in a population of distantly related P. taeda individuals (ADEPT2) used for association genetic studies and a multiple-family pedigree used for genomic selection (CCLONES). The prevalence and extent of LD was greater in CCLONES as compared to ADEPT2; however, extended LD with LGs or between LGs was rare in both populations. The average squared correlations, r(2), between SNP alleles less than 1 cM apart were less than 0.05 in both populations and r(2) did not decay substantially with genetic distance.

The plant-specific FCS-Like Zinc finger (FLZ) gene family is characterized by the presence of a FCS-Like Zinc finger (FLZ) domain which mediates the protein-protein interaction. In this study, we identified that the expansion of FLZ gene family size in different species is correlated with ancestral and lineage-specific whole genome duplication events. The subsequent gene loss found to have a greater role in determining the size of this gene family in many species. However, genomic block duplications played the significant role in the expansion of FLZ gene family in some species.

To help develop strategies for an appropriate use of reproductive seed material on reforestation sites, ensuring better chances of seedling survival in salt-affected areas, we have studied the responses of young spruce seedlings to salt treatments. The specific aim of the work was to identify the optimal salt stress biomarkers in Picea abies, using as experimental material seedlings obtained by germination of seeds with origin in seven populations from the Romanian Carpathian Mountains. These responses included general, conserved reactions such as the accumulation of ions and different osmolytes in the seedlings needles, reduction in photosynthetic pigments levels, or activation of antioxidant systems. Although changes in the contents of different compounds involved in these reactions can be associated to the degree of stress affecting the plants, we propose that the (decreasing) levels of total phenolics or total carotenoids and the (increasing) levels of Na+ or K+ ions in Picea abies needles, should be considered as the most reliable and useful biomarkers for salt stress in this species.

The biomass burning trajectories were compared with regional climate trends reconstructed from general circulation models, tree biomass reconstructed from pollen series, and human population densities. We found that non-uniform climate, vegetation and human drivers acted on regional biomass burning history. In the open coniferous forest/tundra and dense coniferous forest, the regional biomass burning was primarily shaped by gradual establishment of less climate-conducive burning conditions over 5000 years. In the mixed boreal forest an increasing relative proportion of flammable conifers in landscapes since 2000 BP contributed to maintaining biomass burning constant despite climatic conditions less favourable to fires. In the temperate forest, biomass burning was uncoupled with climatic conditions and the main driver was seemingly vegetation until European colonization, i.e. 300 BP.

Intra-annual dynamics of stem water deficit (ΔW), maximum daily shrinkage (MDS), and radial growth (RG) were compared among saplings (stem diameter/height: 2.2 cm/93 cm; n = 7) and mature adult trees (25 cm/12.7 m; n = 6) during 2014. ΔW, MDS, and RG were extracted from stem diameter variations, which were continuously recorded by automatic dendrometers and the influence of environmental drivers was evaluated by applying moving correlation analysis (MCA). Additionally, we used Morlet wavelet analysis to assess the differences in cyclic radial stem variations between saplings and mature trees. Results indicate that saplings and mature trees were experiencing water limitation throughout the growing season. However, saplings exhibited a more strained stem water status and higher sensitivity to environmental conditions than mature trees. Hence, the significantly lower radial increments in saplings (0.16 ± 0.03 mm) compared to mature trees (0.54 ± 0.14 mm) is related to more constrained water status in the former, affecting the rate and duration of RG. The wavelet analysis consistently revealed more distinct diurnal stem variations in saplings compared to mature trees. Intra-annual RG was most closely related to climate variables that influence transpiration, i.e., vapor pressure deficit, relative air humidity, and air temperature. MCA, however, showed pronounced instability of climate-growth relationships, which masked missing temporal or significant correlations when the entire study period (April-October) was considered.

The results indicate that the total C storage of forest ecosystems in Shaanxi increased by approximately 29.3%, from 611.72 Tg in 1993 to 790.75 Tg in 2008, partially as a result of ecological restoration projects. The spatial pattern of C storage in forest ecosystems mainly exhibited a latitude-zonal distribution across the province, increasing from north (high latitude) to south (low latitude) generally, which signifies the effect of environmental conditions, chiefly water and heat related factors, on forest growth and C sequestration. In addition, different data sources and estimation methods had a significant effect on the results obtained, with the C stocks in 2008 being considerably overestimated (864.55 Tg) and slightly underestimated (778.07 Tg) when measured using the mean C density method and integrated method, respectively. Overall, our results demonstrated that the forest ecosystem in Shaanxi acted as a C sink over the last few decades. However, further studies should be carried out with a focus on adaption of plants to environmental factors along with forest management for vegetation restoration to maximize the C sequestration potential and to better cope with climate change."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["Robinia pseudoacacia","Pinus tabulaeformis","Cunninghamia lanceolata","Cupressus funebris","Abies fabri","Picea asperata","Quercus spp","Larix gmelinii","Pinus tabuliformis","Pinus armandii","Pinus massoniana","Cupressus funebris","Cunninghamia lanceolata","Tsuga chinensis","Cunninghamia lanceolata","Tsuga chinensis","Cunninghamia lanceolata","Pinus massoniana","Cunninghamia lanceolata","Tsuga chinensis","Larix gmelinii","Larix gmelinii","Pinus armandii","Pinus tabuliformis","Pinus massoniana","Cunninghamia lanceolata","Robinia pseudoacacia","Tsuga chinensis","Pinus massoniana","Cunninghamia funebris","Pinus massoniana","Pinus tabuliformis","Cupressus funebris","Larix gmelinii","Pinus tabuliformis","Pinus armandii","Pinus massoniana","Cupressus funebris"],"genera":["Abies","Abies","Abies"]},"PMC4564692":{"title":["Plasticity in variation of xylem and phloem cell characteristics of Norway spruce under different local conditions."],"authors":["Gričar J, Prislan P, de Luis M, Gryc V, Hacurová J, Vavrčík H, Čufar K."],"doi":["10.3389/fpls.2015.00730"],"abstract":["There is limited information on intra-annual plasticity of secondary tissues of tree species growing under different environmental conditions.

Anatomical characteristics of xylem and phloem cells are predominantly site-specific characteristics, because they varied among sites but were fairly uniform among years in trees from the same site. Xylem and phloem tissues formed in the first part of the growing season seemed to be more stable in structure, indicating their priority over latewood and late phloem for tree performance.

Vibrational (infrared and Raman) spectroscopies offer chemical characterization of pollen via identifiable spectral features without any sample pretreatment. We have compared the level of chemical information that can be obtained by different multiscale vibrational spectroscopic techniques.Pollen from 15 different species of Pinales (conifers) were measured by seven infrared and Raman methodologies. In order to obtain infrared spectra, both reflectance and transmission measurements were performed on ground and intact pollen grains (bulk measurements), in addition, infrared spectra were obtained by microspectroscopy of multigrain and single pollen grain measurements. For Raman microspectroscopy measurements, spectra were obtained from the same pollen grains by focusing two different substructures of pollen grain. The spectral data from the seven methodologies were integrated into one data model by the Consensus Principal Component Analysis, in order to obtain the relations between the molecular signatures traced by different techniques.The vibrational spectroscopy enabled biochemical characterization of pollen and detection of phylogenetic variation. The spectral differences were clearly connected to specific chemical constituents, such as lipids, carbohydrates, carotenoids and sporopollenins. The extensive differences between pollen of Cedrus and the rest of Pinaceae family were unambiguously connected with molecular composition of sporopollenins in pollen grain wall, while pollen of Picea has apparently higher concentration of carotenoids than the rest of the family. It is shown that vibrational methodologies have great potential for systematic collection of data on ecosystems and that the obtained phylogenetic variation can be well explained by the biochemical composition of pollen. Out of the seven tested methodologies, the best taxonomical differentiation of pollen was obtained by infrared measurements on bulk samples, as well as by Raman microspectroscopy measurements of the corpus region of the pollen grain. Raman microspectroscopy measurements indicate that measurement area, as well as the depth of focus, can have crucial influence on the obtained data."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["Podocarpus neriifolius","Abies cephalonica","Abies cephalonica","Abies cephalonica","Abies cephalonica","Cedrus atlantica","Cedrus atlantica","Cedrus atlantica","Cedrus atlantica","Cedrus atlantica","Cedrus atlantica","Cedrus atlantica","Cedrus atlantica","Cedrus atlantica","Cedrus atlantica","Cedrus atlantica","Podocarpus neriifolius","Podocarpus neriifolius","Cedrus atlantica","Podocarpus neriifolius","Podocarpus neriifolius","Cedrus atlantica","Cedrus atlantica"],"genera":["Cedrus","Picea","Pinus","Picea","Pinus","Abies","Cedrus","Pinus","Picea","Cedrus","Picea","Pinus","Abies","Cedrus","Cedrus","Cedrus","Cedrus","Cedrus","Cedrus","Cedrus","Pinus","Picea","Picea","Picea","Picea","Abies","Cedrus","Picea","Pinus","Pinus","Picea"]},"PMC4576002":{"title":["Bioinformatics Methods and Biological Interpretation for Next-Generation Sequencing Data."],"authors":["Wang G, Liu Y, Zhu D, Klau GW, Feng W."],"doi":["10.1155/2015/690873"],"abstract":"","journal":"BioMed research international","species":["A. gambiae","A. gambiae","A. gambiae","Oryza sativa","Picea abies","Crocus sativus"],"genera":["Arabidopsis"]},"PMC4586145":{"title":["Serendipitous Meta-Transcriptomics: The Fungal Community of Norway Spruce (Picea abies)."],"authors":["Delhomme N, Sundström G, Zamani N, Lantz H, Lin YC, Hvidsten TR, Höppner MP, Jern P, Van de Peer Y, Lundeberg J, Grabherr MG, Street NR."],"doi":["10.1371/journal.pone.0139080"],"abstract":["After performing de novo transcript assembly of >1 billion RNA-Sequencing reads obtained from 22 samples of different Norway spruce (Picea abies) tissues that were not surface sterilized, we found that assembled sequences captured a mix of plant, lichen, and fungal transcripts.

To determine the degree of conservation of this pathway we searched for key genes among land plants. We used OrthoMCL and the OrthoMCL Viridiplantae database to analyze proteomes of species in bryophytes, lycophytes, monilophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. We also analyzed small RNA size categories and, in two gymnosperms, cytosine methylation in ribosomal DNA. Six proteins were restricted to angiosperms, these being NRPD4/NRPE4, RDM1, DMS3 (defective in meristem silencing 3), SHH1 (SAWADEE homeodomain homolog 1), KTF1, and SUVR2, although we failed to find the latter three proteins in Fritillaria persica, a species with a giant genome. Small RNAs of 24 nt in length were abundant only in angiosperms. Phylogenetic analyses of Dicer-like (DCL) proteins showed that DCL2 was restricted to seed plants, although it was absent in Gnetum gnemon and Welwitschia mirabilis. The data suggest that phases (1) and (2) of the RdDM pathway, described for model angiosperms, evolved with angiosperms. The absence of some features of RdDM in F. persica may be associated with its large genome. Phase (3) is probably the most conserved part of the pathway across land plants. DCL2, involved in virus defense and interaction with the canonical RdDM pathway to facilitate methylation of CHH, is absent outside seed plants. Its absence in G. gnemon, and W. mirabilis coupled with distinctive patterns of CHH methylation, suggest a secondary loss of DCL2 following the divergence of Gnetales."],"journal":"Genome biology and evolution","species":["Fritillaria persica","Gnetum gnemon","Welwitschia mirabilis","Fritillaria persica","Gnetum gnemon","Welwitschia mirabilis","Arabidopsis thaliana","Amborella trichopoda","Fritillaria persica","Ginkgo biloba","Gnetum gnemon","Picea abies","Pinus taeda","Welwitschia mirabilis","Pteridium aquilinum","Selaginella moellendorffii","Physcomitrella patens","Fritillaria persica","Welwitschia mirabilis","Fritillaria persica","Welwitschia mirabilis","Fritillaria persica","Fritillaria persica","Welwitschia mirabilis","Welwitschia mirabilis","Welwitschia mirabilis","Welwitschia mirabilis","Oryza sativa","Ricinus communis","Chlamydomonas reinhardtii","Ostreococcus tauri","Volvox carteri","Welwitschia mirabilis","Nicotiana tabacum","Cycas revoluta","Welwitschia mirabilis","Z. mays","Oryza sativa","Oryza sativa","Ricinus communis","Fritillaria perisca","Z. mays","Oryza sativa","Welwitschia mirabilis","Welwitschia mirabilis","Selaginella moellendorffii","Fritillaria persica","Physcomitrella patens","Selaginella moellendorffii","Pteridium aquilinum","Pinus taeda","Picea abies","Welwitschia mirabilis","Gnetum gnemon","Ginkgo biloba","Amborella trichopoda","Fritillaria persica","Oryza sativa","Arabidopsis thaliana","Fritillaria persica","Z. mays","Amborella trichopoda","Arabidopsis trich","Arabidopsis lyrata","Arabidopsis lyrat","Arabidopsis thaliana","Arabidopsis thali","Brachypodium distachyon","Brachypodium dista","Brassica rapa","Brachypodium rapa","Camelina sativa","Chlamydomonas sativ","Capsella rubella","Chlamydomonas rubel","Cicer arietinum","Chlamydomonas ariet","Citrus clementine","Chlamydomonas cleme","Citrus sinensis","Chlamydomonas sinen","Cucumis melo","Chlamydomonas melo","Cucumis sativus","Chlamydomonas sativu","Eucalyptus grandis","Eucalyptus grand","Eutrema salsugineum","Eucalyptus salsu","Fragaria vesca","Fritillaria vesca","Glycine max","Gnetum max","Medicago truncatula","Medicago trunc","Morus notabilis","Medicago notab","Musa acuminata","Medicago malac","Nelumbo nucifera","Nicotiana nucif","Nicotiana sylvestris","Nicotiana sylve","Nicotiana tomentosiformis","Nicotiana tomen","Phaseolus vulgaris","Picea vulga","Phoenix dactylifera","Picea dacty","Populus trichocarpa","Picea trich","Prunus mume","Picea mume","Prunus persica","Picea persi","Picea brets","Ricinus communis","Ricinus commu","Setaria italica","Selaginella itali","Solanum lycopersicum","Selaginella lycop","Solanum tuberosum","Selaginella tuber","Theobroma cacao","Theobroma cacao","Vitis vinifera","Volvox vinif","Z. mays","Z. mays","Welwitschia mirabilis","Selaginella moellendorffii","Welwitschia mirabilis","Ginkgo biloba","Gnetum gnemon","Gn. gnemon","Gn. gnemon","Nicotiana tabacum","Nicotiana tabacum","Welwitschia mirabilis","Pt. aquilinum","Selaginella moellendorffii","Welwitschia mirabilis","Cunninghamia lanceolata","Larix leptolepis","Pt. aquilinum","Z. mays","Fritillaria persica","Fritillaria imperialis","Fritillaria persica"],"genera":["Ginkgo","Ephedra","Arabidopsis","Citrus","Cucumis","Theobroma","Fragaria","Pyrus","Pyrus","Fritillaria","Fritillaria"]},"PMC4607949":{"title":["Biophysical optimality of the golden angle in phyllotaxis."],"authors":["Okabe T."],"doi":["10.1038/srep15358"],"abstract":["Plant leaves are arranged around a stem axis in a regular pattern characterized by common fractions, a phenomenon known as phyllotaxis or phyllotaxy.

This mathematical regularity originates from leaf primordia at the shoot tip (shoot apical meristem), which successively arise at fixed intervals of a divergence angle, typically the golden angle of 137.5°. Algebraic and numerical interpretations have been proposed to explain the golden angle observed in phyllotaxis. However, it remains unknown whether phyllotaxis has adaptive value, even though two centuries have passed since the phenomenon was discovered. Here, I propose a new adaptive mechanism explaining the presence of the golden angle. This angle is the optimal solution to minimize the energy cost of phyllotaxis transition. This model accounts for not only the high precision of the golden angle but also the occurrences of other angles observed in nature.

To determine how this variation is inherited across generations, we conducted a progeny test and examined the development of cold hardening in open-pollinated second-generation (F2) progeny of Abies sachalinensis. The F1 parents had different genetic backgrounds resulting from reciprocal interpopulational crosses between low-elevation (L) and high-elevation (H) populations: L × L, L × H, H × L, and H × H. Paternity analysis of the F2 progeny using molecular genetic markers showed that 91.3% of the fathers were located in surrounding stands of the F1 planting site (i.e., not in the F1 test population). The remaining fathers were assigned to F1 parents of the L × L cross-type. This indicates that the high-elevation genome in the F1 parents was not inherited by the F2 population via pollen flow. The timing of autumn cold acclimation in the F2 progeny depended on the cross-type of the F1 mother. The progeny of H × H mothers showed less damage in freezing tests than the progeny of other cross-types. Statistical modeling supported a linear effect of genome origin. In the best model, variation in freezing damage was explained by the proportion of maternally inherited high-elevation genome. These results suggest that autumn cold acclimation was partly explained by the additive effect of the responsible maternal genome. Thus, the offspring that inherited a greater proportion of the high-elevation genome developed cold hardiness earlier. Genome-based variation in the regulation of autumn cold acclimation matched the local climatic conditions, which may be a key factor in elevation-dependent adaptation."],"journal":"Frontiers in plant science","species":["Abies sachalinensis","Abies sachalinensis","Abies sachalinensis","Sasa senanensis","Stigmella kurilensis","Abies sachalinensis","Abies sachalinensis","Abies sachalinensis","Abies sachalinensis","Abies sachalinensis","Abies sachalinensis","Pinus densiflora","Abies sachalinensis","Abies sachalinensis","Picea abies","Pinus taeda","Abies sachalinensis","Abies sachalinensis","Abies sachalinensis"],"genera":["Abies"]},"PMC4619436":{"title":["The NAC transcription factor family in maritime pine (Pinus Pinaster): molecular regulation of two genes involved in stress responses."],"authors":["Pascual MB, Cánovas FM, Ávila C."],"doi":["10.1186/s12870-015-0640-0"],"abstract":["NAC transcription factors comprise a large plant-specific gene family involved in the regulation of diverse biological processes. Despite the growing number of studies on NAC transcription factors in various species, little information is available about this family in conifers. The goal of this study was to identify the NAC transcription family in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster), to characterize ATAF-like genes in response to various stresses and to study their molecular regulation.We have isolated two maritime pine NAC genes and using a transient expression assay in N. benthamiana leaves estudied the promoter jasmonate response.In this study, we identified 37 NAC genes from maritime pine and classified them into six main subfamilies. The largest group includes 12 sequences corresponding to stress-related genes. Two of these NAC genes, PpNAC2 and PpNAC3, were isolated and their expression profiles were examined at various developmental stages and in response to various types of stress. The expression of both genes was strongly induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA), mechanical wounding, and high salinity. The promoter regions of these genes were shown to contain cis-elements involved in the stress response and plant hormonal regulation, including E-boxes, which are commonly found in the promoters of genes that respond to jasmonate, and binding sites for bHLH proteins. Using a transient expression assay in N. benthamiana leaves, we found that the promoter of PpNAC3 was rapidly induced upon MeJA treatment, while this response disappeared in plants in which the transcription factor NbbHLH2 was silenced.Our results suggest that PpNAC2 and PpNAC3 encode stress-responsive NAC transcription factors involved in the jasmonate response in pine. Furthermore, these data also suggest that the jasmonate signaling pathway is conserved between angiosperms and gymnosperms.

This special tree community has been the subject of several studies aimed at learning more about the genetic structure and ecology of the species and the potential effects of climate change. The spatial distribution of trees is a result of many ecological processes and can affect the degree of competition between neighbouring trees, tree density, variability in size and distribution, regeneration, survival, growth, mortality, crown formation and the biological diversity within forest communities. Numerous scale-dependent measures have been established in order to describe spatial forest structure. The overall aim of most of these studies has been to obtain data to help design preservation and conservation strategies. In this study, we examined the spatial distribution pattern of trees in the P. chihuahuana tree community in 12 localities, in relation to i) tree stand density, ii) diameter distribution (vertical structure), iii) tree species diversity, iv) geographical latitude and v) tree dominance at a fine scale (in 0.25 ha plots), with the aim of obtaining a better understanding of the complex ecosystem processes and biological diversity. Because of the strongly mixed nature of this tree community, which often produces low population densities of each tree species and random tree fall gaps caused by tree death, we expect aggregated patterns in individual Picea chihuahuana trees and in the P. chihuahuana tree community, repulsive Picea patterns to other tree species and repulsive patterns of young to adult trees. Each location was represented by one plot of 50 x 50 m (0.25 ha) established in the centre of the tree community. The findings demonstrate that the hypothesis of aggregated tree pattern is not applicable to the mean pattern measured by Clark-Evans index, Uniform Angle index and Mean Directional index of the uneven-aged P. chihuahuana trees and P. chihuahuana tree community and but to specific spatial scales measured by the univariate L-function. The spatial distribution pattern of P. chihuahuana trees was found to be independent of patches of other tree species measured by the bivariate L-function. The spatial distribution was not significantly related to tree density, diameter distribution or tree species diversity. The index of Clark and Evans decreased significantly from the southern to northern plots containing all tree species. Self-thinning due to intra and inter-specific competition-induced mortality is probably the main cause of the decrease in aggregation intensity during the course of population development in this tree community. We recommend the use of larger sampling plots (> 0.25 ha) in uneven-aged and species-rich forest ecosystems to detect less obvious, but important, relationships between spatial tree pattern and functioning and diversity in these forests."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Abies durangensis","Cupressus lindleyi","Picea chihuahuana","Pinus arizonica","Pinus strobiformis","Pinus cooperi","Pinus leiophylla","Pinus teocote","Populus tremuloides","Prunus serotina","Pseudotsuga menziesii","Quercus sideroxyla","Quercus crassifolia","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Abies durangensis","Cupressus lindleyi","Juniperus deppeana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana","Picea chihuahuana"],"genera":["Picea","Juniperus","Cupressus","Picea","Picea","Picea","Picea","Picea","Picea","Picea"]},"PMC4620457":{"title":["Surface soil phytoliths as vegetation and altitude indicators: a study from the southern Himalaya."],"authors":["An X, Lu H, Chu G."],"doi":["10.1038/srep15523"],"abstract":["Phytoliths represent one of the few available altitudinal vegetation proxies for mountain ecosystems.

The statistical results show a good correlation between phytolith assemblages and these five altitudinal vegetation zones: the five phytolith assemblages identified effectively differentiated these five altitudinal vegetation zones.

Additionally, we tested the phytolith index Ic (a proxy for estimating the percentage of Pooideae vis-à-vis the total grass content) as a quantifier of phytolith variety versus altitude. Ic increased along altitude, as expected. An investigation of phytoliths provided an initial basis for the analysis of the composition of gramineous vegetation.

In addition, the highly heterozygous genetic background of tree species suggests that they may have more complex mechanisms of response and tolerance to B deficiency than do model plants. Boron-deficient trees usually exhibit two key visible symptoms: depression of growing points (root tip, bud, flower, and young leaf) and deformity of organs (root, shoot, leaf, and fruit). These symptoms may be ascribed to B functioning in the cell wall and membrane, and particularly to damage to vascular tissues and the suppression of both B and water transport. Boron deficiency also affects metabolic processes such as decreased leaf photosynthesis, and increased lignin and phenol content in trees. These negative effects will influence the quality and quantity of wood, fruit and other agricultural products. Boron efficiency probably originates from a combined effect of three processes: B uptake, B translocation and retranslocation, and B utilization. Root morphology and mycorrhiza can affect the B uptake efficiency of trees. During B translocation from the root to shoot, differences in B concentration between root cell sap and xylem exudate, as well as water use efficiency, may play key roles in tolerance to B deficiency. In addition, B retranslocation efficiency primarily depends on the extent of xylem-to-phloem transfer and the variety and amount of cis-diol moieties in the phloem. The B requirement for cell wall construction also contribute to the B use efficiency in trees. The present review will provide an update on the physiological and molecular responses and tolerance mechanisms to B deficiency in woody plants. Emphasis is placed on the roles of B reserves that are more important for tolerance to B deficiency in trees than in herbaceous plants and the possible physiological and molecular mechanisms of differential B efficiency in trees. We propose that B may be used to study the relationship between the cell wall and the membrane via the B-bridge. Transgenic B-efficient tree cultivars have considerable potential for forestry or fruit rootstock production on low B soils in the future."],"journal":"Frontiers in plant science","species":["Pinus taeda","Vitis vinifera","Morus alba","Carica papaya","Picea abies","Coffea arabica","Citrus grandis","Citrus sinensis","Phaseolus vulgaris","Malus domestics","Pyrus communis","Prunus domestics","Prunus avium","Arabidopsis thaliana","Oryza sative","Citrus macrophylla","Hordeum vulgare","Poncirus trifoliata","Citrus sinensis","Poncirus trifoliata","Betula pendula","Citrus junos","Solanum lycopersicum","Nicotiana tabacum","Eucalyptus grandis","Eucalyptus urophylla","Eucalyptus grandis","Eucalyptus urophylla"],"genera":["Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis"]},"PMC4626799":{"title":["Plant Species Rather Than Climate Greatly Alters the Temporal Pattern of Litter Chemical Composition During Long-Term Decomposition."],"authors":["Li Y, Chen N, Harmon ME, Li Y, Cao X, Chappell MA, Mao J."],"doi":["10.1038/srep15783"],"abstract":["A feedback between decomposition and litter chemical composition occurs with decomposition altering composition that in turn influences the decomposition rate.

The seasonal variation of total P (Pt) and its fractions along a young soil chronosequence (Hailuogou chronosequence) on the eastern slope of Gongga Mountain, SW China, was investigated based on the modified Hedley fractionation technique to understand P loss during the early pedogenesis stage. The results showed that the mineral P (mainly apatite) was the dominant fraction of Pt in the C horizon of the soil, and the seasonal difference in Pt and its fractions was insignificant. In the A horizon, Pt concentrations decreased markedly compared with those in the C horizon, and as the age of the soil increased, the inorganic P (Pi) significantly decreased and the organic P (Po) prominently increased. Seasonally, the P fractions exhibited various distributions in the A horizon. The variation of Pt and its fractions revealed that the P loss was rapid along the 120-year soil chronosequence. The P stocks in soils (0-30 cm) started to decrease at the 52 year site. And the P stock depletion reached almost 17.6% at the 120-year site. The loss of P from the soil of the Hailuogou chronosequence was mainly attributed to weathering, plant uptake, and transport by runoff. About 36% P loss was transported into plant biomass P at the 120 year site.

The current study tested whether this assumption is actually valid, or whether efflux of gases from the stem during freezing reduces the occurrence of embolism.CO2 efflux measurements were conducted during freezing experiments for saplings of three Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and three Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees under laboratory conditions, and the magnitudes of the freezing-related bursts of CO2 released from the stems were analysed using a previously published mechanistic model of CO2 production, storage, diffusion and efflux from a tree stem. The freezing-related bursts of CO2 released from a mature Scots pine tree growing in field conditions were also measured and analysed.Substantial freezing-related bursts of CO2 released from the stem were found to occur during both the laboratory experiments and under field conditions. In the laboratory, the fraction of CO2 released from the stem ranged between 27 and 96 % of the total CO2 content within the stem.All gases dissolved in the xylem sap are not trapped within the ice in the stem during freezing, as has previously been assumed, thus adding a new dimension to the understanding of winter embolism formation.

These forest management types include age class forests of young managed beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), with beech stands age of approximately 30 years, age class beech stands with an age of approximately 70 years, unmanaged beech stands, and coniferous stands dominated by either pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) or spruce (Picea abies Karst.) which are located in three study sites across Germany. Soil were sampled from 48 study plots and we employed fungal ITS rDNA pyrotag sequencing to assess the soil fungal diversity and community structure. We found that forest management type significantly affects the Shannon diversity of soil fungi and a significant interaction effect of study site and forest management on the fungal operational taxonomic units richness. Consequently distinct fungal communities were detected in the three study sites and within the four forest management types, which were mainly related to the main tree species. Further analysis of the contribution of soil properties revealed that C/N ratio being the most important factor in all the three study sites whereas soil pH was significantly related to the fungal community in two study sites. Functional assignment of the fungal communities indicated that 38% of the observed communities were Ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) and their distribution is significantly influenced by the forest management. Soil pH and C/N ratio were found to be the main drivers of the ECM fungal community composition. Additional fungal community similarity analysis revealed the presence of study site and management type specific ECM genera.

To address if this activity is conserved among vascular plants, we performed comparative analyses of TDIF signaling in non-flowering vascular plants (gymnosperms, ferns and lycophytes). We identified orthologs of TDIF/CLE as well as its receptor TDR/PXY (TDIF RECEPTOR/PHLOEM INTERCALATED WITH XYLEM) in Ginkgo biloba, Adiantum aethiopicum, and Selaginella kraussiana by RACE-PCR.

We found that liquid culturing of dissected leaves or shoots was useful for examining TDIF activity during vascular development. TDIF treatment suppressed xylem/tracheary element differentiation of procambial cells in G. biloba and A. aethiopicum leaves. In contrast, neither TDIF nor putative endogenous TDIF inhibited xylem differentiation in developing shoots and rhizophores of S. kraussiana. These data suggest that activity of TDIF in vascular development is conserved among extant euphyllophytes.

Although information is available regarding the previous process-mediated generation of embryogenic cells to form somatic embryos, there is a dearth of information in the literature on the detailed structure of these clusters.The main aim of this study was to provide a more detailed structure of the embryogenic tissue clusters obtained through the in vitro propagation of the Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). We primarily focused on the growth of early somatic embryos (ESEs). The data on ESE growth suggested that there may be clear distinctions between their inner and outer regions. Therefore, we selected ESEs collected on the 56th day after sub-cultivation to dissect the homogeneity of the ESE clusters. Two colourimetric assays (acetocarmine and fluorescein diacetate/propidium iodide staining) and one metabolic assay based on the use of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride uncovered large differences in the metabolic activity inside the cluster. Next, we performed nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The ESE cluster seemed to be compactly aggregated during the first four weeks of cultivation; thereafter, the difference between the 1H nuclei concentration in the inner and outer clusters was more evident. There were clear differences in the visual appearance of embryos from the outer and inner regions. Finally, a cluster was divided into six parts (three each from the inner and the outer regions of the embryo) to determine their growth and viability. The innermost embryos (centripetally towards the cluster centre) could grow after sub-cultivation but exhibited the slowest rate and required the longest time to reach the common growth rate. To confirm our hypothesis on the organisation of the ESE cluster, we investigated the effect of cluster orientation on the cultivation medium and the influence of the change of the cluster's three-dimensional orientation on its development. Maintaining the same position when transferring ESEs into new cultivation medium seemed to be necessary because changes in the orientation significantly affected ESE growth.This work illustrated the possible inner organisation of ESEs. The outer layer of ESEs is formed by individual somatic embryos with high metabolic activity (and with high demands for nutrients, oxygen and water), while an embryonal group is directed outside of the ESE cluster. Somatic embryos with depressed metabolic activity were localised in the inner regions, where these embryonic tissues probably have a very important transport function."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["Picea abies","Picea taedea","Picea mariana","Picea roxburghii","Picea bungeana","Picea elliotii","Picea nigra","Picea massoniana","Picea caribaea","Picea silvestris","Picea strobus","Picea abies","Picea abies","Larix decidua","Picea abies","Daucus carota","Betula pendula","Ipomoea batatas","Picea abies","Scenedesmus armatus","Pinus sylvestris","Picea abies"],"genera":["Picea","Pinus","Pinus","Picea"]},"PMC4669935":{"title":["Catalog of the adelgids of the world (Hemiptera, Adelgidae)."],"authors":["Favret C, Havill NP, Miller GL, Sano M, Victor B."],"doi":["10.3897/zookeys.534.6456"],"abstract":["A taxonomic and nomenclatural Catalogue of the adelgids (Hemiptera: Adelgidae) is presented.

Here, we collected wool materials produced from 1962 to 2010 and investigated the long-term WUE of an alpine meadow in Tibet on basis of the carbon isotope values of vegetation (δ13Cveg). The values of δ13Cveg decreased by 1.34‰ during 1962-2010, similar to changes in δ13C values of atmospheric CO2. Carbon isotope discrimination was highly variable and no trend was apparent in the past half century. Intrinsic water use efficiency (Wi) increased by 18 μmol·mol-1 (approximately 23.5%) during 1962-2010 because the increase in the intercellular CO2 concentration (46 μmol·mol-1) was less than that in the atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ca, 73 μmol·mol-1). In addition, Wi increased significantly with increasing growing season temperature and Ca. However, effective water use efficiency (We) remained relatively stable, because of increasing vapor pressure deficit. Ca, precipitation, and growing season temperature collectively explained 45% of the variation of We. Our findings indicate that the We of alpine meadows in the Tibetan Plateau remained relatively stable by physiological adjustment to elevated Ca and growing season temperature.

We also investigate functional diversification of the G-protein complex in Picea abies by analysing transcriptional regulation of the G-protein subunits in different tissues and in response to pathogen infection.A full repertoire of G-protein subunits in several conifer species were identified in silico. The full-length P. abies coding regions of one Gα-, one Gβ- and four Gγ-subunits were cloned and sequenced. The phylogenetic analysis of the Gγ-subunits showed that PaGG1 clustered with A-type-like subunits, PaGG3 and PaGG4 clustered with C-type-like subunits, while PaGG2 and its orthologs represented a novel conifer-specific putative Gγ-subunit type. Gene expression analyses by quantitative PCR of P. abies G-protein subunits showed specific up-regulation of the Gα-subunit gene PaGPA1 and the Gγ-subunit gene PaGG1 in response to Heterobasidion annosum sensu lato infection.Conifers possess a full repertoire of G-protein subunits.

One of the most pressing threats to cultivation of some pine species is the pitch canker fungus, Fusarium circinatum, which can have devastating effects in both the field and nursery. Investigation of the Pinus-F. circinatum host-pathogen interaction is crucial for development of effective disease management strategies. As with many non-model organisms, investigation of host-pathogen interactions in pine species is hampered by limited genomic resources. This was partially alleviated through release of the 22 Gbp Pinus taeda v1.01 genome sequence ( http://pinegenome.org/pinerefseq/ ) in 2014. Despite the fact that the fragmented state of the genome may hamper comprehensive transcriptome analysis, it is possible to leverage the inherent redundancy resulting from deep RNA sequencing with Illumina short reads to assemble transcripts in the absence of a completed reference sequence. These data can then be integrated with available genomic data to produce a comprehensive transcriptome resource. The aim of this study was to provide a foundation for gene expression analysis of disease response mechanisms in Pinus patula through transcriptome assembly.Eighteen de novo and two reference based assemblies were produced for P. patula shoot tissue. For this purpose three transcriptome assemblers, Trinity, Velvet/OASES and SOAPdenovo-Trans, were used to maximise diversity and completeness of assembled transcripts. Redundancy in the assembly was reduced using the EvidentialGene pipeline. The resulting 52 Mb P. patula v1.0 shoot transcriptome consists of 52 112 unigenes, 60 % of which could be functionally annotated.The assembled transcriptome will serve as a major genomic resource for future investigation of P. patula and represents the largest gene catalogue produced to date for this species. Furthermore, this assembly can help detect gene-based genetic markers for P. patula and the comparative assembly workflow could be applied to generate similar resources for other non-model species."],"journal":"BMC genomics","species":["Fusarium circinatum","Fusarium circinatum","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Fusarium circinatum","Fusarium circinatum","Pinus patula","Pinus radiata","Pinus tecunumanii","Fusarium circinatum","Pinus patula","Pinus tecunumanii","Fusarium circinatum","Pinus taeda","Pinus banksiana","Pinus lambertiana","Pinus pinaster","Pinus radiata","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus taeda","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Fusarium circinatum","Fusarium circinatum","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus taeda","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus banksiana","Pinus contorta","Pinus pinaster","Pinus palustris","Pinus lambertiana","Pinus radiata","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Fusarium fujikuroi","Fusarium oxysporum","Bipolaris maydis","Leptosphaeria maculans","Pinus patula","Picea glauca","Pinus taeda","Pinus pinaster","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus glauca","Picea mariana","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus abies","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Arabidopsis thaliana","Glycine max","Populus trichocarpa","Ricinus communis","Theobroma cacao","Vitis vinifera","Selaginella moellendorffii","Physcomitrella patens","Oryza sativa","Picea abies","Picea sitchensis","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Amborella trichopoda","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus banksiana","Pinus contorta","Pinus lambertiana","Pinus patula","Pinus radiata","Pinus taeda","Pinus banksiana","Pinus contorta","Pinus patula","Pinus radiata","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus taeda","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus contorta","Pinus pinaster","Pinus radiata","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Magnoporthe oryzae","Pinus sylvestris","Fusarium circinatum","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Fusarium circinatum","Pinus patula","Pinus tecunumanii","Pinus patula","Fusarium circinatum","Pinus tecunumanii","Pinus patula","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula","Pinus taeda","Pinus patula"],"genera":["Pinus","Pinus","Left","Right","Left","Right"]},"PMC4678887":{"title":["Responses of photosynthetic parameters to drought in subtropical forest ecosystem of China."],"authors":["Zhou L, Wang S, Chi Y, Li Q, Huang K, Yu Q."],"doi":["10.1038/srep18254"],"abstract":["The mechanism underlying the effect of drought on the photosynthetic traits of leaves in forest ecosystems in subtropical regions is unclear.

We present evidence for three ancient genome duplications during the evolution of gymnosperms, based on phylogenomic analyses of transcriptomes from 24 gymnosperms and 3 outgroups. We use a new algorithm to place these WGD events in phylogenetic context: two in the ancestry of major conifer clades (Pinaceae and cupressophyte conifers) and one in Welwitschia (Gnetales). We also confirm that a WGD hypothesized to be restricted to seed plants is indeed not shared with ferns and relatives (monilophytes), a result that was unclear in earlier studies. Contrary to previous genomic research that reported an absence of polyploidy in the ancestry of contemporary gymnosperms, our analyses indicate that polyploidy has contributed to the evolution of conifers and other gymnosperms.

Pinus fujiii is characterized by a large female cone in which the apophyses with a centromucronate prickle-like umbo are arranged in 8:13 parastichies, and deciduous seed wings. These characters suggest that P. fujiii belongs to the section Trifoliae of the subgenus Pinus, which is now restricted to North and Central America and the Caribbean islands. Fossil data suggest that the P. fujiii lineage firstly appeared in Japan around the Eocene/Oligocene boundary. We speculate that the P. fujiii lineage might have moved southward to Japan from a refugium located elsewhere in high-latitude areas in response to the late Eocene cooling event, as occurred with other Trifoliae species in North America."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["Pinus trifolia","Pinus trifolia","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus trifolia","Pinus fujiii","Pinus mikii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus trifolia","Pinus trifolia","Pinus sabiniana","Pinus trifolia","Pinus trifolia","Pinus trifolia","Pinus trifolia","Pinus trifolia","Pinus trifolia","Pinites fujiii","Pinites fujiii","Pinites fujiii","Pinus trifolia","Pinus trifolia","Pinus trifolia","Pinites fujiii","Pinites fujiii","Pinites fujiii","Glyptostrobus pensilis","Metasequoia disticha","Fortunearia sinensis","Liquidamber formosana","Fagus stuxbergii","Carya striata","Nyssa sylvatica","Pinus trifolia","Pinus fujiii","Arrow head","Pinus fujiii","Pinites fujiii","Pinus trifolia","Pinus fujiii","Pinites fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus engelhardtii","Pinus lawsoniana","Pinus piperi","Pinus truckeensis","Pinus fujiii","Pinus engelhardtii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus truckeensis","Pinus fujiii","Pinus truckeensis","Pinus fujiii","Pinus truckeensis","Pinus fujiii","Pinus trifolia","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus miocenica","Pinus mikii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus mikii","Pinus thunbergii","Pinus tabuliformis","Pinites fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinites fujiii","Pinus trifolia","Pinus trifolia","Pinites fujiii","Pinus trifolia","Pinus trifolia","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus trifolia","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus canariensis","Pinus roxburghii","Pinus canariensis","Pinus roxburghii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus canariensis","Pinus roxburghii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus pinaster","Pinus palustris","Pinus rigida","Pinus pinaster","Pinus fujiii","Pinus trifolia","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus coulteri","Pinus fujiii","Pinus jeffreyi","Pinus sabineana","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii","Pinus fujiii"],"genera":["Trifoliae","Trifoliae","Pinus","Contortae","Australes","Ponderosae","Trifoliae","Trifoliae","Trifoliae","Taeda","Ponderosae","Trifoliae","Pinus","Trifoliae","Pinaster","Trifoliae","Pinaster","Pinus","Pinus","Pinus","Pinites","Pinus","Trifoliae","Ponderosae","Pinaster","Pinaster","Taeda","Trifoliae","Australes","Trifoliae","Ponderosae","Trifoliae","Trifoliae","Trifoliae","Trifoliae","Trifoliae"]},"PMC4691086":{"title":["De Novo Transcriptome Sequencing Analysis of cDNA Library and Large-Scale Unigene Assembly in Japanese Red Pine (Pinus densiflora)."],"authors":["Liu L, Zhang S, Lian C."],"doi":["10.3390/ijms161226139"],"abstract":["Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora) is extensively cultivated in Japan, Korea, China, and Russia and is harvested for timber, pulpwood, garden, and paper markets.

Thirty-five ECM fungal taxa were distinguished on root tips of A. alba from all tested stands with 22 to 27 ECM fungal taxa in the individual stand. The diversity and similarity metrics revealed a lack of statistical differences in the structure of the ECM fungal community between stands varying in overstory tree composition. Cenococcum geophilum was the most common fungal species at all investigated A. alba stands, with an abundance of 50 to 70%.

A 500-day incubation experiment was carried out on soils from an 11 °C-gradient mountainous system on Changbai Mountain in northeast China. Soil respiration during the incubation fitted well to a three-pool (labile, intermediate and stable) SOC decomposition model. A correlation analysis revealed that the MAT only influenced the labile carbon pool size and not the SOC stability. The intermediate carbon pool contributed dominantly to cumulative carbon release. The size of the intermediate pool was strongly related to the percentage of sand particle. The decomposition rate of the intermediate pool was negatively related to soil nitrogen availability. Because both soil texture and nitrogen availability are temperature independent, the stability of SOC was not associated with the MAT, but was heavily influenced by the intrinsic processes of SOC formation and the nutrient status."],"journal":"Scientific reports","species":["Pinus koraiensis","Betula ermanii"],"genera":["Picea","Abies","Picea","Abies","Larix","Abies"]},"PMC4705065":{"title":["Replacing monocultures with mixed-species stands: Ecosystem service implications of two production forest alternatives in Sweden."],"authors":["Felton A, Nilsson U, Sonesson J, Felton AM, Roberge JM, Ranius T, Ahlström M, Bergh J, Björkman C, Boberg J, Drössler L, Fahlvik N, Gong P, Holmström E, Keskitalo EC, Klapwijk MJ, Laudon H, Lundmark T, Niklasson M, Nordin A, Pettersson M, Stenlid J, Sténs A, Wallertz K."],"doi":["10.1007/s13280-015-0749-2"],"abstract":["Whereas there is evidence that mixed-species approaches to production forestry in general can provide positive outcomes relative to monocultures, it is less clear to what extent multiple benefits can be derived from specific mixed-species alternatives.

Greater differences, sometimes exceeding 10-15 %, were found for individual regions or forest type groups. Differences varied in magnitude and direction; one equation set did not consistently produce a higher or lower estimate than the other.Biomass estimates for a few forest type groups are clearly not equivalent between the two equation sets-southern pines, northern spruce-fir, and lower productivity arid western forests-while estimates for the majority of forest type groups are generally equivalent at the scales presented.

All names combined in or synonymised with Otidea are dealt with. Thirty-three species are treated, with full descriptions and colour illustrations provided for 25 of these. Five new species are described, viz. O. borealis, O. brunneoparva, O. oregonensis, O. pseudoleporina and O. subformicarum. Otidea cantharella var. minor and O. onotica var. brevispora are elevated to species rank. Otideopsis kaushalii is combined in the genus Otidea. A key to the species of Otidea is given. An LSU dataset containing 167 sequences (with 44 newly generated in this study) is analysed to place collections and determine whether the named Otidea sequences in GenBank were identified correctly. Fourty-nine new ITS sequences were generated in this study. The ITS region is too variable to align across Otidea, but had low intraspecific variation and it aided in species identifications. Thirty type collections were studied, and ITS and LSU sequences are provided for 12 of these.

As much as 100 different EM fungal species can coexist and interact with the same tree species, forming complex multispecies networks in soils. The degree of host specificity and structural properties of these interaction networks (e.g., nestedness and modularity) may influence plant and fungal community assembly and species coexistence, yet their structure has been little studied in northern coniferous forests, where trees depend on EM fungi for nutrient acquisition. We used high-throughput sequencing to characterize the composition and diversity of bulk soil and root-associated fungal communities in four co-occurring Pinaceae in a relic foredune plain located at Îles de la Madeleine, Québec, Canada. We found high EM fungal richness across the four hosts, with a total of 200 EM operational taxonomic units (OTUs), mainly belonging to the Agaricomycetes. Network analysis revealed an antinested pattern in both bulk soil and roots EM fungal communities. However, there was no detectable modularity (i.e., subgroups of interacting species) in the interaction networks, indicating a low level of specificity in these EM associations. In addition, there were no differences in EM fungal OTU richness or community structure among the four tree species. Limited shared resources and competitive exclusion typically restrict the number of taxa coexisting within the same niche. As such, our finding of high EM fungal richness and low host specificity highlights the need for further studies to determine the mechanisms enabling such a large number of EM fungal species to coexist locally on the same hosts."],"journal":"Ecology and evolution","species":["Ammophila breviligulata","Artemisia stellaria","Fetusca rubra","Myrica pensylvanica","Pinus mugo","Myrica gale","Chamaedaphne calyculata","Pinus banksiana","Pinus mugo","Picea mariana","Abies balsamea","Pinus banksiana","Pinus mugo","Picea mariana","Ammophila balsamea","Pinus banksiana","Pinus mugo","Ammophila balsamea","Pinus banksiana","Pinus mugo","Picea mariana","Pinus banksiana","Pinus mugo","Picea mariana","Pinus banksiana","Pinus banksiana","Picea mariana","Abies balsamea","Lactarius deceptivus","Cenococcum geophilum","Picea mariana","Russula bicolor","Ammophila balsamea","Pinus banksiana","Pinus mugo","Abies balsamea","Picea mariana","Abies balsamea","Pinus mugo","Chamaedaphne geophilum","Picea mariana","Picea mariana","Abies balsamea","Pinus banksiana","Pinus mugo"],"genera":["Sebacina","Cenococcum","Sistoderma","Sebacina","Sebacina","Suillus","Suillus","Pinus","Suillus","Cenococcum","Cenococcum","Alnus"]},"PMC4717527":{"title":["The evolution of heat shock protein sequences, cis-regulatory elements, and expression profiles in the eusocial Hymenoptera."],"authors":["Nguyen AD, Gotelli NJ, Cahan SH."],"doi":["10.1186/s12862-015-0573-0"],"abstract":["The eusocial Hymenoptera have radiated across a wide range of thermal environments, exposing them to significant physiological stressors. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of three families of Heat Shock Proteins (Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp40), the primary molecular chaperones protecting against thermal damage, across 12 Hymenopteran species and four other insect orders. We also predicted and tested for thermal inducibility of eight Hsps from the presence of cis-regulatory heat shock elements (HSEs). We tested whether Hsp induction patterns in ants were associated with different thermal environments.We found evidence for duplications, losses, and cis-regulatory changes in two of the three gene families. One member of the Hsp90 gene family, hsp83, duplicated basally in the Hymenoptera, with shifts in HSE motifs in the novel copy. Both copies were retained in bees, but ants retained only the novel HSE copy. For Hsp70, Hymenoptera lack the primary heat-inducible orthologue from Drosophila melanogaster and instead induce the cognate form, hsc70-4, which also underwent an early duplication. Episodic diversifying selection was detected along the branch predating the duplication of hsc70-4 and continued along one of the paralogue branches after duplication. Four out of eight Hsp genes were heat-inducible and matched the predictions based on presence of conserved HSEs. For the inducible homologues, the more thermally tolerant species, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, had greater Hsp basal expression and induction in response to heat stress than did the less thermally tolerant species, Aphaenogaster picea. Furthermore, there was no trade-off between basal expression and induction.Our results highlight the unique evolutionary history of Hsps in eusocial Hymenoptera, which has been shaped by gains, losses, and changes in cis-regulation. Ants, and most likely other Hymenoptera, utilize lineage-specific heat inducible Hsps, whose expression patterns are associated with adaptive variation in thermal tolerance between two ant species. Collectively, our analyses suggest that Hsp sequence and expression patterns may reflect the forces of selection acting on thermal tolerance in ants and other social Hymenoptera."],"journal":"BMC evolutionary biology","species":["Drosophila melanogaster","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Tribolium castaneum","Acyrthosiphon pisum","Nasonia vitripennis","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Drosophila melanogaster","Nasonia vitripennis","Drosophila melanogaster","Drosophila melanogaster","Drosophila melanogaster","C. quinque","Nasonia vitripennis","Aphaenogaster pisum","Aphaenogaster pisum","S. invicta","C. quinquefasciatus","Aphaenogaster pisum","Drosophila melanogaster","Drosophila melanogaster","Drosophila melanogaster","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Culex quinquefasciatus","Apis mellifera","Drosophila melanogaster","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Formica polyctena","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Drosophila melanogaster","Drosophila melanogaster","Drosophila melanogaster","Drosophila melanogaster","Culex quinquefasciatus","Drosophila melanogaster","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Tribolium molitor","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus","Aphaenogaster pisum","Aphaenogaster pisum","Aphaenogaster pisum","Aphaenogaster picea","Pogonomyrmex barbatus"],"genera":["Apis","Bombus","Bombus","Drosophila","Cataglyphis"]},"PMC4718046":{"title":["Plant traits, productivity, biomass and soil properties from forest sites in the Pacific Northwest, 1999-2014."],"authors":["Berner LT, Law BE."],"doi":["10.1038/sdata.2016.2"],"abstract":["Plant trait measurements are needed for evaluating ecological responses to environmental conditions and for ecosystem process model development, parameterization, and testing.

Complex multitrait adaptations to different ecological regions such as boreal, montane, coastal, and arid environments accounted for 15-20% of the total variance. This population differentiation could be directly linked to climate variables through multivariate regression tree analysis. Our results suggest that adaptation to climate does not always correspond linearly to temperature gradients. For example, opposite trait values (e.g., early versus late budbreak) may be found in response to apparently similar cold environments (e.g., boreal and montane). Climate change adaptation strategies may therefore not always be possible through a simple shift of seed sources along environmental gradients.

Overall, we recorded a total of 66,209 lichen occurrences belonging to 57 species in the 96 studied forest stands. We found no difference in species richness of lichens between stands of P. contorta and P. sylvestris, but stands of P. abies had higher total species richness. However, species richness of lichens in stands of P. abies decreased with increasing stand age, while no such age effect was detected for P. contorta and P. sylvestris. Lichen species composition progressively diverged with increasing stand age, and in 30-year-old stands all three tree species showed species-specific assemblages. Epiphytic lichen assemblages in stands of 30-year-old P. contorta were influenced by greater basal area, canopy closure, and average diameter at breast height, P. abies stands by higher branch density and canopy closure, and stands of P. sylvestris by greater bark crevice depth. Differences in lichen species richness and composition were mainly explained by canopy closure and habitat availability, and the greater canopy closure in mature P. abies stands promoted the colonization and growth of calicioid lichen species. Our results indicate that the non-native P. contorta have similar species richness as the native P. sylvestris.

We also provide summaries on voltinism, crawler emergence timing, and predictive models for crawler emergence to assist in developing soft scale management programs. Phloem-feeding soft scale pests cause direct (e.g., injuries to plant tissues and removal of nutrients) and indirect damage (e.g., reduction in photosynthesis and aesthetic value by honeydew and sooty mold). Variations in life cycle, reproduction, fecundity, and behavior exist among congenerics due to host, environmental, climatic, and geographical variations. Sampling of soft scale pests involves sighting the insects or their damage, and assessing their abundance. Crawlers of most univoltine species emerge in the spring and the summer. Degree-day models and plant phenological indicators help determine the initiation of sampling and treatment against crawlers (the life stage most vulnerable to contact insecticides). The efficacy of cultural management tactics, such as fertilization, pruning, and irrigation, in reducing soft scale abundance is poorly documented. A large number of parasitoids and predators attack soft scale populations in the field; therefore, natural enemy conservation by using selective insecticides is important. Systemic insecticides provide greater flexibility in application method and timing, and have longer residual longevity than contact insecticides.

We detected the effects of phylogeny and climate through trait-variation-based K statistics and phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR) analyses. Multivariate analyses were performed to detect trait variation along climatic gradients with species replacement. The estimated K-values for the nine studied morphometric traits ranged from 0.19 to 0.68, and the studied environmental variables explained 39-83% of the total trait variation. Trait variation tended to be determined largely by a temperature gradient varying from wet-cool climates to dry-warm summers and, additionally, by a moisture gradient. As the climate became wetter and cooler, spruce species tended to be replaced by other spruces with smaller needle leaves and seeds but larger cones and seed scales. A regression analysis showed that spruce species tended to be successively replaced by other species, along the gradient, although the trends observed within species were not necessarily consistent with the overall trend. The climatically driven replacement of the spruces in question could be well indicated by the between-species variation in morphometric traits that carry lower phylogenetic signal. Between-species variation in these traits is driven primarily by climatic factors. These species demonstrate a narrower ecological amplitude in temperature but wider ranges on the moisture gradient."],"journal":"Ecology and evolution","species":["P. jezoensis","P. schrenkiana","P. crassifolia","P. meyeri","P. likiangensis","P. likiangensis","P. purpurea","P. brachytyla","P. asperata","P. jezoensis","P. wilsonii","P. meyeri","P. brachytyla","P. jezoensis","P. wilsonii","P. meyeri","P. purpurea","P. likiangensis","P. crassifolia","P. schrenkiana","Picea asperata","Picea meyeri","Picea likiangensis","Picea likiangensis","Picea brachytyla","Picea purpurea","Picea crassifolia","Picea wilsonii","Picea jezoensis","Picea abies","Picea brachytyla","Picea engelmannii","Picea meyeri","Picea jezoensis","Picea mariana","Picea schrenkiana","Picea jezoensis","Picea mariana","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia"],"genera":["Picea","Picea","Picea"]},"PMC4726009":{"title":["Functional characterization of the late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein gene family from Pinus tabuliformis (Pinaceae) in Escherichia coli."],"authors":["Gao J, Lan T."],"doi":["10.1038/srep19467"],"abstract":["Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are a large and highly diverse gene family present in a wide range of plant species.

The slow pace of exotic plant invasions in mountain ecosystems is likely due to a combination of low anthropogenic disturbances, low propagule supply, and extreme/steep environmental gradients. The importance of any one of these factors is debated and likely ecosystem dependent. We evaluated the importance of various correlates of plant invasions in the Wallowa Mountain Range of northeastern Oregon and explored whether non-native species distributions differed from native species along an elevation gradient. Vascular plant communities were sampled in summer 2012 along three mountain roads. Transects (n = 20) were evenly stratified by elevation (~70 m intervals) along each road. Vascular plant species abundances and environmental parameters were measured. We used indicator species analysis to identify habitat affinities for non-native species. Plots were ordinated in species space, joint plots and non-parametric multiplicative regression were used to relate species and community variation to environmental variables. Non-native species richness decreased continuously with increasing elevation. In contrast, native species richness displayed a unimodal distribution with maximum richness occurring at mid-elevations. Species composition was strongly related to elevation and canopy openness. Overlays of trait and environmental factors onto non-metric multidimensional ordinations identified the montane-subalpine community transition and over-story canopy closure exceeding 60% as potential barriers to non-native species establishment. Unlike native species, non-native species showed little evidence for high-elevation or closed-canopy specialization. These data suggest that non-native plants currently found in the Wallowa Mountains are dependent on open canopies and disturbance for establishment in low and mid elevations. Current management objectives including restoration to more open canopies in dry Rocky Mountain forests, may increase immigration pressure of non-native plants from lower elevations into the montane and subalpine zones."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["Abies lasiocarpa","Picea engelmannii","Pinus contorta","Abies lasiocarpa","Ventenata dubia","Thinopyrum intermedium","Taraxacum officinale","Arrhenatherum elatius","Cryptantha affinis","Vaccinium membranaceum","Sanguisorba annua","Madia glomerata","Leptosiphon harknessii","Polygonum douglasii","Thalictrum occidentale","Melica subulata","Rumex acetosella","Spergularia rubra","Epilobium minutum","Anaphalis margaritacea","Abies lasiocarpa","Polemonium pulcherrimum","Spergularia rubra","Spergularia rubra","Rumex acetosella","Abies lasiocarpa","Arenaria aculeata","Bromus arvensis","Goodyera oblongifolia","Rumex acetosella","Spergularia rubra","Taraxacum laevigatum","Viola orbiculata","Abies lasiocarpa","Vaccinium scoparium","Spergularia rubra","Rumex acetosella","Clintonia uniflora","Pinus ponderosa","Plantago lanceolata","Taraxacum laevigatum","Taraxacum laevigatum","Taraxacum officinale","Cynoglossum officinale","Ventenata dubia","Pseudoroegneria spicata","Festuca idahoensis","Carex geyeri","Achillea millefolium","Spergularia rubra","Rumex acetosella","Spergularia rubra","Spergularia rubra","Rumex acetosella","Pinus ponderosa"],"genera":[]},"PMC4738281":{"title":["DNA barcoding reveals a mysterious high species diversity of conifer-feeding aphids in the mountains of southwest China."],"authors":["Chen R, Jiang LY, Chen J, Qiao GX."],"doi":["10.1038/srep20123"],"abstract":["The mountains of southwest China are one of the hot spots of biodiversity in the world.

For invertebrates, pitfall or flight-interception traps are commonly used, but sampling solution differs widely between studies, which could influence the communities collected and affect sample processing (morphological or genetic). We assessed arthropod communities with flight-interception traps using three commonly used sampling solutions across two forest types and two vertical strata. We first considered the effect of sampling solution and its interaction with forest type, vertical stratum, and position of sampling jar at the trap on sample condition and community composition. We found that samples collected in copper sulphate were more mouldy and fragmented relative to other solutions which might impair morphological identification, but condition depended on forest type, trap type and the position of the jar. Community composition, based on order-level identification, did not differ across sampling solutions and only varied with forest type and vertical stratum. Species richness and species-level community composition, however, differed greatly among sampling solutions. Renner solution was highly attractant for beetles and repellent for true bugs. Secondly, we tested whether sampling solution affects subsequent molecular analyses and found that DNA barcoding success was species-specific. Samples from copper sulphate produced the fewest successful DNA sequences for genetic identification, and since DNA yield or quality was not particularly reduced in these samples additional interactions between the solution and DNA must also be occurring. Our results show that the choice of sampling solution should be an important consideration in biodiversity studies. Due to the potential bias towards or against certain species by Ethanol-containing sampling solution we suggest ethylene glycol as a suitable sampling solution when genetic analysis tools are to be used and copper sulphate when focusing on morphological species identification and facing financial restrictions in biodiversity studies."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["Fagus sylvatica","Picea abies","Fagus sylvatica","Quercus robur","Picea abies","Larix decidua","Abies alba","Pseudotsuga menziesii","Pinus sylvestris","Agathidium seminulum","Athous subfuscus","Corticaria abietorum","Corticarina lambiana","Cychramus variegatus","Metacantharis discoidea","Plectophloeus fischeri","Rhynchaenus fagi","Trixagus dermestoides","Psallus varians","Athous subfuscus","Cychramus variegatus","Metacantharis discoidea","Xyleborus germanus","Athous subfuscus","Eusphalerum sorbi","Rhynchaenus fagi","Picea abies","Fagus sylvatica","Fagus sylvatica","Picea abies","Abies subfuscus","Corticaria lambiana","Picea fischeri","Corticaria abietorum","Corticaria variegatus","Rhynchaenus fagi","Picea fischeri","Abies subfuscus"],"genera":[]},"PMC4744691":{"title":["Xylem cavitation resistance can be estimated based on time-dependent rate of acoustic emissions."],"authors":["Nolf M, Beikircher B, Rosner S, Nolf A, Mayr S."],"doi":["10.1111/nph.13476"],"abstract":["Acoustic emission (AE) analysis allows nondestructive monitoring of embolism formation in plant xylem, but signal interpretation and agreement of acoustically measured hydraulic vulnerability with reference hydraulic techniques remain under debate.

These birds are important seed dispersers for at least ten conifer species in the western U.S., including whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), an obligate mutualist of Clark's nutcrackers. For effective conservation of both Clark's nutcrackers and whitebark pine, it is essential to ensure stability of Clark's nutcracker populations. My objectives were to examine Clark's nutcracker breeding season home range size, territoriality, habitat selection, and foraging behavior in the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, a region where whitebark pine is declining. I radio-tracked Clark's nutcrackers in 2011, a population-wide nonbreeding year following a low whitebark pine cone crop, and 2012, a breeding year following a high cone crop. Results suggest Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) communities are important habitat for Clark's nutcrackers because they selected it for home ranges. In contrast, they did not select whitebark pine habitat. However, Clark's nutcrackers did adjust their use of whitebark pine habitat between years, suggesting that, in some springs, whitebark pine habitat may be used more than previously expected. Newly extracted Douglas-fir seeds were an important food source both years. On the other hand, cached seeds made up a relatively lower proportion of the diet in 2011, suggesting cached seeds are not a reliable spring food source. Land managers focus on restoring whitebark pine habitat with the assumption that Clark's nutcrackers will be available to continue seed dispersal. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, Clark's nutcracker populations may be more likely to be retained year-round when whitebark pine restoration efforts are located adjacent to Douglas-fir habitat. By extrapolation, whitebark pine restoration efforts in other regions may consider prioritizing restoration of whitebark pine stands near alternative seed sources."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["Nucifraga columbiana","Pinus albicaulis","Pseudotsuga menziesii","Ambystoma maculatum","Nucifraga columbiana","Pinus albicaulis","Cronartium ribicola","Dendroctonus ponderosae","Pinus ponderosa","Pinus jeffreyi","Pseudotsuga menziesii","Pinus edulis","Pinus monophylla","Pinus flexilis","Pinus contorta","Picea englemannii","Abies lasiocarpa","Artemesia tridentata","Dendroctonus ponderosae"],"genera":[]},"PMC4757406":{"title":["Rapid Discovery and Functional Characterization of Terpene Synthases from Four Endophytic Xylariaceae."],"authors":["Wu W, Tran W, Taatjes CA, Alonso-Gutierrez J, Lee TS, Gladden JM."],"doi":["10.1371/journal.pone.0146983"],"abstract":["Endophytic fungi are ubiquitous plant endosymbionts that establish complex and poorly understood relationships with their host organisms.

Out of the 26 TPS's profiled, 12 TPS's were functional, with the majority of them exhibiting both monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthase activity."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["E. coli","Hypoxylon sp","Hypoxylon sp","Hypoxylon sp","Daldinia eschscholzii","E. coli","Hypoxylon sp","Hypoxylon sp","Hypoxylon sp","Daldinia eschscholzii","E. coli","E. coli","Abies grandis","E. coli","E. coli","Hypoxylon sp","Hypoxylon sp","Hypoxylon sp","Daldinia eschscholzii","Trichoderma virens","Neurospora tetraspema","E. coli","Abies grandis","E. coli","Daldinia eschscholzii","Hypoxylon sp","Abies grandis","E. coli","Pinus taeda","Abies grandis","Artemisia annua","Cannabis sativa","Picea abies","E. coli","Aquilaria crassna","Hypoxylon sp","Artimisia annua","Solidago canadensis","Abies grandis","Eucalyptus grandis","Hypoxylon sp","Daldinia eschscholzii","Eucalyptus coli","Eucalyptus coli"],"genera":["Arabidopsis"]},"PMC4758241":{"title":["Organellar Genomes of White Spruce (Picea glauca): Assembly and Annotation."],"authors":["Jackman SD, Warren RL, Gibb EA, Vandervalk BP, Mohamadi H, Chu J, Raymond A, Pleasance S, Coope R, Wildung MR, Ritland CE, Bousquet J, Jones SJ, Bohlmann J, Birol I."],"doi":["10.1093/gbe/evv244"],"abstract":["The genome sequences of the plastid and mitochondrion of white spruce (Picea glauca) were assembled from whole-genome shotgun sequencing data using ABySS.

Hence, assembly of the 123-kb plastid and 5.9-Mb mitochondrial genomes were accomplished by analyzing data sets primarily representing low coverage of the nuclear genome. The assembled organellar genomes were annotated for their coding genes, ribosomal RNA, and transfer RNA. Transcript abundances of the mitochondrial genes were quantified in three developmental tissues and five mature tissues using data from RNA-seq experiments. C-to-U RNA editing was observed in the majority of mitochondrial genes, and in four genes, editing events were noted to modify ACG codons to create cryptic AUG start codons.

For convenience, spatial scale is defined as individual tree, neighborhood, stand, and landscape. Whether a given canopy-leveling disturbance will initiate a sequence of development in structure with little change in composition or initiate an episode of succession depends on a match or mismatch, respectively, with traits of the dominant tree species that allow the species to survive disturbance. When these match, certain species-disturbance type combinations lock in a pattern of stand and landscape dynamics that can persist for several generations of trees; thus, dominant tree species regulate, as well as respond to, disturbance. A complex interaction among tree species, neighborhood effects, disturbance type and severity, landform, and soils determines how stands of differing composition form and the mosaic of stands that compose the landscape. Neighborhood effects (e.g., serotinous seed rain, sprouting, shading, leaf-litter chemistry, and leaf-litter physical properties) operate at small spatial extents of the individual tree and its neighbors but play a central role in forest dynamics by contributing to patch formation at stand scales and dynamics of the entire landscape. Dominance by tree species with neutral to negative neighborhood effects leads to unstable landscape dynamics in disturbance-prone regions, wherein most stands are undergoing succession; stability can only occur under very low-severity disturbance regimes. Dominance by species with positive effects leads to stable landscape dynamics wherein only a small proportion of stands undergo succession at any one time. Positive neighborhood effects are common in temperate and boreal zones, whereas negative effects are more common in tropical climates. Landscapes with positive dynamics have alternate categories of dynamics stabilized by high-severity and low-severity disturbance regimes. Contrary to prevailing ecological theory, systems with positive neighborhood effects can have similar levels of compositional stability across tree, stand, and landscape scales. Neighborhood effect theory can help explain responses of landscapes to large-scale land clearing and novel effects brought on by factors such as invasive species and deer overabundance."],"journal":"F1000Research","species":["Betula alleghaniensis","Populus deltoides","Betula papyrifera","Picea mariana","Quercus macrocarpa","Pinus banksiana","Tsuga canadensis","Acer saccharum","Pinus strobus","Abies balsamea","Pinus resinosa","Pseudotsuga menziesii","Quercus rubra"],"genera":["Quercus"]},"PMC4760746":{"title":["Transcriptome-derived microsatellite markers for Dioon (Zamiaceae) cycad species."],"authors":["Prado A, Cervantes-Díaz F, Perez-Zavala FG, González-Astorga J, Bede JC, Cibrián-Jaramillo A."],"doi":["10.3732/apps.1500087"],"abstract":["Dioon (Zamiaceae) is an endangered North American cycad genus of evolutionary and ornamental value.

Woody ornamental plants provide early- and late-season resources for adults emerging from and returning to overwintering sites, as well as feeding and breeding sites for H. halys throughout the growing season. In this study, we quantify the use of diverse plants by H. halys in two commercial nurseries in Maryland, recording data on the abundance of egg masses, early and late instar nymphs, and adults over a three-year study period. Our specific goals were to provide a quantitative comparison of the use of diverse plant species and cultivated varieties, identify non-hosts that could be used to create landscapes refractory to H. halys, and determine whether the use of plants varied across life stages of H. halys or the taxonomic status of plants. We found broad use of diverse plants in this study, identifying 88 host plants used by all life stages of H. halys. We also highlight the 43 plant taxa that did not support any life stage of H. halys and are thus classified as non-hosts. Interestingly, some of these plants were congeners of highly-used plants, underscoring high intrageneric and intraspecific variation in the use of plants by this polyphagous herbivore.

Structurally, EXTs are characterized by the repeated occurrence of serine (Ser) followed by three to five prolines (Pro) residues, which are hydroxylated as hydroxyproline (Hyp) and glycosylated. Some EXTs have Tyrosine (Tyr)-X-Tyr (where X can be any amino acid) motifs that are responsible for intramolecular or intermolecular cross-linkings. EXTs can be divided into several classes: classical EXTs, short EXTs, leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs), proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinases (PERKs), formin-homolog EXTs (FH EXTs), chimeric EXTs, and long chimeric EXTs. To guide future research on the EXTs and understand evolutionary history of EXTs in the plant kingdom, a bioinformatics study was conducted to identify and classify EXTs from 16 fully sequenced plant genomes, including Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Volvox carteri, Klebsormidium flaccidum, Physcomitrella patens, Selaginella moellendorffii, Pinus taeda, Picea abies, Brachypodium distachyon, Zea mays, Oryza sativa, Glycine max, Medicago truncatula, Brassica rapa, Solanum lycopersicum, and Solanum tuberosum, to supplement data previously obtained from Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus trichocarpa.

Several notable findings were made: (1) classical EXTs were likely derived after the terrestrialization of plants; (2) LRXs, PERKs, and FHs were derived earlier than classical EXTs; (3) monocots have few classical EXTs; (4) Eudicots have the greatest number of classical EXTs and Tyr-X-Tyr cross-linking motifs are predominantly in classical EXTs; (5) green algae have no classical EXTs but have a number of long chimeric EXTs that are absent in embryophytes.

For 200 dead standing mountain pines (Pinus montana) located along gradients of aspect, slope steepness and elevation in the Swiss National Park, radial annual growth rates and lifespan were reconstructed. While early growth (i.e. mean tree-ring width over the first 50 years) correlated positively with diameter at the time of tree death, a negative correlation resulted with lifespan, i.e. rapidly growing mountain pines face a trade-off between reaching a large diameter at the cost of early tree death. Slowly growing mountain pines may reach a large diameter and a long lifespan, but risk to die young at a small size. Early growth was not correlated with temperature or precipitation over the growing period. Variability in lifespan was further contingent on aspect, slope steepness and elevation.

To test whether evolutionary extension of thermal limits is accomplished through enhanced cellular stress response (enhanced response), constitutively elevated expression of protective genes (genetic assimilation) or a shift from damage resistance to passive mechanisms of thermal stability (tolerance), we conducted an analysis of the reactionome: the reaction norm for all genes in an organism's transcriptome measured across an experimental gradient. We characterized thermal reactionomes of two common ant species in the eastern U.S, the northern cool-climate Aphaenogaster picea and the southern warm-climate Aphaenogaster carolinensis, across 12 temperatures that spanned their entire thermal breadth.We found that at least 2 % of all genes changed expression with temperature. The majority of upregulation was specific to exposure to low temperatures. The cool-adapted A. picea induced expression of more genes in response to extreme temperatures than did A. carolinensis, consistent with the enhanced response hypothesis. In contrast, under high temperatures the warm-adapted A. carolinensis downregulated many of the genes upregulated in A. picea, and required more extreme temperatures to induce down-regulation in gene expression, consistent with the tolerance hypothesis.

In recent decades, experimental design, phenotyping methods, climatic data and statistical analyses have improved greatly and refined but not radically changed knowledge of clines. The maintenance of local adaptation despite high gene flow suggests selection for local adaptation to climate is strong. Concerns over maladaptation resulting from climate change have motivated many new genecological and population genomics studies; however, few jurisdictions have implemented assisted gene flow (AGF), the translocation of pre-adapted individuals to facilitate adaptation of planted forests to climate change. Here, we provide evidence that temperate tree species show clines along climatic gradients sufficiently similar for average patterns or climate models to guide AGF in the absence of species-specific knowledge. Composite provenancing of multiple seed sources can be used to increase diversity and buffer against future climate uncertainty.

The correlation of soil total carbon (STC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) along altitudinal gradients and correlation between soil organic carbon (SOC) and STN was significantly positive with the values R(2) = 0.1684, p = 0.01, R(2) = 0.1537, p = 0.009 and R(2) = 0.856, p = 7.31E-10 respectively, while it was non-significant between soil inorganic carbon (SIC) and altitude and also between SIC and STN. The concentration of SOC and STN was highest in the broad leaved Betula utilis forest (22.31, 1.6 %) and least in the mixed (Pinus, Juniper, Betula) forest soil (0.85, 0.09 %) respectively. In the tree species leaf total carbon (LTC) and leaf total nitrogen (LTN) were highest in the Pinus wallichiana (PW) (632.54, 19.77), and least in the Populus alba (87.59, 4.06).

We measured the foliar fungal disease incidence on 16 different tree species in 209 plots in six European countries, representing a forest-type gradient from the Mediterranean to boreal forests.

The effect of tree species richness on disease incidence varied with latitude and functional type. Disease incidence tended to increase with tree diversity, in particular in northern latitudes.

For instance, numerous studies have reported positive species diversity-productivity relationships in plant communities. However, other aspects of structural diversity such as individual size inequality have been far less investigated. In forests, tree size inequality impacts directly tree growth and asymmetric competition, but consequences on forest productivity are still indeterminate. In addition, the effect of tree size inequality on productivity is likely to vary with species shade-tolerance, a key ecological characteristic controlling asymmetric competition and light resource acquisition. Using plot data from the French National Geographic Agency, we studied the response of stand productivity to size inequality for ten forest species differing in shade tolerance. We fitted a basal area stand production model that included abiotic factors, stand density, stand development stage and a tree size inequality index. Then, using a forest dynamics model we explored whether mechanisms of light interception and light use efficiency could explain the tree size inequality effect observed for three of the ten species studied. Size inequality negatively affected basal area increment for seven out of the ten species investigated. However, this effect was not related to the shade tolerance of these species. According to the model simulations, the negative tree size inequality effect could result both from reduced total stand light interception and reduced light use efficiency. Our results demonstrate that negative relationships between size inequality and productivity may be the rule in tree populations. The lack of effect of shade tolerance indicates compensatory mechanisms between effect on light availability and response to light availability. Such a pattern deserves further investigations for mixed forests where complementarity effects between species are involved.

A tensile test was conducted after root samples were grouped by diameter and moisture content. The results showedthat:1) root moisture content had a significant influence on tensile properties; 2) slightly loss of root moisture content could enhance tensile strength, but too much loss of water resulted in weaker capacity for root elongation, and consequently reduced tensile strength; 3) root diameter had a strong positive correlation with tensile resistance; and4) the roots of Betula platyphylla had the best tensile properties when both diameter and moisture content being controlled.

Previous studies investigated the occurrence of SWR in ecosystems with different vegetation cover but did not clarify its relationships with litter biochemical quality. Here, we investigated the capability of different plant litter types to induce SWR by using fresh and decomposed leaf materials from 12 species, to amend a model sandy soil over a year-long microcosm experiment. Water repellency, measured by the Molarity of an Ethanol Droplet (MED) test, was tested for the effects of litter species and age, and compared with litter quality assessed by 13C-CPMAS NMR in solid state and elemental chemical parameters. All litter types were highly water repellent, with MED values of 18% or higher. In contrast, when litter was incorporated into the soil, only undecomposed materials induced SWR, but with a large variability of onset and peak dynamics among litter types. Surprisingly, SWR induced by litter addition was unrelated to the aliphatic fraction of litter. In contrast, lignin-poor but labile C-rich litter, as defined by O-alkyl C and N-alkyl and methoxyl C of 13C-CPMAS NMR spectral regions, respectively, induced a stronger SWR. This study suggests that biochemical quality of plant litter is a major controlling factor of SWR and, by defining litter quality with 13C-CPMAS NMR, our results provide a significant novel contribution towards a full understanding of the relationships between plant litter biochemistry and SWR."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["Pinus halepensis","Quercus coccifera","Juniperus oxycedrus","Rosmarinus officinalis","Quercus ilex","Retama sphaerocarpa","Quercus suber","Ampelodesmos mauritanicus","Festuca drymeia","Arbutus unedo","Coronilla emerus","Hedera helix","Cupressus sempervirens","Picea excelsa","Pinus halepensis","Quercus ilex","Castanea sativa","Populus nigra","Robinia pseudoacacia","Quercus suber","Pinus pinaster","Eucalyptus globulus"],"genera":["Castanea","Picea","Pinus","Hedera","Hedera","Castanea","Pinus","Robinia","Hedera","Ampelodesmos","Quercus","Castanea","Festuca","Cupressus","Arbutus","Populus","Pinus","Robinia","Quercus","Eucalyptus","Picea","Robinia","Cupressus","Picea","Pinus","Picea","Populus","Cupressus","Populus"]},"PMC4817349":{"title":["Limited Growth Recovery after Drought-Induced Forest Dieback in Very Defoliated Trees of Two Pine Species."],"authors":["Guada G, Camarero JJ, Sánchez-Salguero R, Cerrillo RM."],"doi":["10.3389/fpls.2016.00418"],"abstract":["Mediterranean pine forests display high resilience after extreme climatic events such as severe droughts. However, recent dry spells causing growth decline and triggering forest dieback challenge the capacity of some forests to recover following major disturbances. To describe how resilient the responses of forests to drought can be, we quantified growth dynamics in plantations of two pine species (Scots pine, black pine) located in south-eastern Spain and showing drought-triggered dieback. Radial growth was characterized at inter- (tree-ring width) and intra-annual (xylogenesis) scales in three defoliation levels. It was assumed that the higher defoliation the more negative the impact of drought on tree growth. Tree-ring width chronologies were built and xylogenesis was characterized 3 years after the last severe drought occurred. Annual growth data and the number of tracheids produced in different stages of xylem formation were related to climate data at several time scales. Drought negatively impacted growth of the most defoliated trees in both pine species. In Scots pine, xylem formation started earlier in the non-defoliated than in the most defoliated trees. Defoliated trees presented the shortest duration of the radial-enlargement phase in both species. On average the most defoliated trees formed 60% of the number of mature tracheids formed by the non-defoliated trees in both species. Since radial enlargement is the xylogenesis phase most tightly related to final growth, this explains why the most defoliated trees grew the least due to their altered xylogenesis phases. Our findings indicate a very limited resilience capacity of drought-defoliated Scots and black pines. Moreover, droughts produce legacy effects on xylogenesis of highly defoliated trees which could not recover previous growth rates and are thus more prone to die."],"journal":"Frontiers in plant science","species":["Pinus halepensis","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus nigra","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus nigra","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus nigra","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus nigra","Picea mariana","Abies alba","Thaumetopoea pityocampa"],"genera":[]},"PMC4819217":{"title":["Impact of Forest Management on Species Richness: Global Meta-Analysis and Economic Trade-Offs."],"authors":["Chaudhary A, Burivalova Z, Koh LP, Hellweg S."],"doi":["10.1038/srep23954"],"abstract":["Forests managed for timber have an important role to play in conserving global biodiversity.

We show that in terms of local species richness loss, forest management types can be ranked, from best to worse, as follows: selection and retention systems, reduced impact logging, conventional selective logging, clear-cutting, agroforestry, timber plantations, fuelwood plantations. Next, we calculated the economic profitability in terms of the net present value of timber harvesting from 10 hypothetical wood-producing Forest Management Units (FMU) from around the globe. The ranking of management types is altered when the species loss per unit profit generated from the FMU is considered.

Interspecific hybrids between P.engelmannii and Pinus arizonica Engelm. have been detected by morphological analysis. The presence of hybrids in P. engelmannii seed stands may affect seed quality and reforestation success. Therefore, the goals of this research were to identify introgressive hybridization between P. engelmannii and other pine species in eight seed stands of this species in Durango, Mexico, and to examine how hybrid proportion is related to mean genetic dissimilarity between trees in these stands, using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers and morphological traits. Differences in the average current annual increment of putative hybrids and pure trees were also tested for statistical significance. Morphological and genetic analyses of 280 adult trees were carried out. Putative hybrids were found in all the seed stands studied. The hybrids did not differ from the pure trees in vigour or robustness. All stands with putative P. engelmannii hybrids detected by both AFLPs and morphological traits showed the highest average values of the Tanimoto distance, which indicates: i) more heterogeneous genetic material, ii) higher genetic variation and therefore iii) the higher evolutionary potential of these stands, and iv) that the morphological differentiation (hybrid/not hybrid) is strongly associated with the Tanimoto distance per stand.

Variability among individuals, regarding the timing of dispersal initiation and travelled distance from source, is assumed to contribute to increased population success through risk spreading. However, experiments are often limited in studying complex dispersal interactions over space and time. By applying a local-scaled individual-based simulation model we studied dispersal and emerging infestation patterns in a host - bark beetle system (Picea abies - Ips typgraphus). More specifically, we (i) investigated the effect of individual variability in beetle physiology (flight capacity) and environmental heterogeneity (host susceptibility level) on population-level dispersal success, and (ii) elucidated patterns of spatial and/or temporal variability in individual dispersal success, host selectivity, and the resulting beetle density within colonized hosts in differently susceptible environments.Individual variability in flight capacity of bark beetles causes predominantly positive effects on population-level dispersal success, yet these effects are strongly environment-dependent: Variability is most beneficial in purely resistant habitats, while positive effects are less pronounced in purely susceptible habitats, and largely absent in habitats where host susceptibility is spatially scattered. Despite success rates being highest in purely susceptible habitats, scattered host susceptibility appeared most suitable for dispersing bark beetle populations as it ensures population spread without drastically reducing success rates. At the individual level, dispersal success generally decreases with distance to source and is lowest in early flight cohorts, while host selectivity increased and colonization density decreased with increasing distance across all environments.Our modelling approach is demonstrated to be a powerful tool for studying movement ecology in bark beetles. Dispersal variability largely contributes to risk spreading among individuals, and facilitates the response of populations to changing environmental conditions. Higher mortality risk suffered by a small part of the dispersing population (long-distance dispersers, pioneers) is likely paid off by reduced deferred costs resulting in fitness benefits for subsequent generations. Both, dispersal variability in space and time, and environmental heterogeneity are characterized as key features which require particular emphasis when investigating dispersal and infestation patterns in tree-killing bark beetles."],"journal":"Movement ecology","species":["Picea abies","Picea abies","D. ponderosae","D. frontalis"],"genera":["Dendroctonus"]},"PMC4842189":{"title":["Biological screening of selected Pacific Northwest forest plants using the brine shrimp (Artemia salina) toxicity bioassay."],"authors":["Karchesy YM, Kelsey RG, Constantine G, Karchesy JJ."],"doi":["10.1186/s40064-016-2145-1"],"abstract":["The brine shrimp (Artemia salina) bioassay was used to screen 211 methanol extracts from 128 species of Pacific Northwest plants in search of general cytotoxic activity.

Before budburst in spring, the leader shoots and 50% of all lateral shoots of half of the investigated 5-year old Abies alba saplings were clipped to simulate browsing. At harvest, different fine-root classes were separated, and starch as an important storage compartment was analysed for concentrations. The phenology had a strong effect on the allocation of the 13C-label from shoots to roots. In spring, shoots did not supply the fine-roots with high amounts of the 13C-label, because the fine-roots contained less than 1% of the applied 13C. In summer and autumn, however, shoots allocated relatively high amounts of the 13C-label to the fine roots. The incorporation of the 13C-label as structural C or as starch into the roots is strongly dependent on the root type and the root diameter. In newly formed fine roots, 3-5% of the applied 13C was incorporated, whereas 1-3% in the ≤0.5 mm root class and 1-1.5% in the >0.5-1.0 mm root class were recorded.

No effects of the clipping were observed after summer and autumn labelling in the 13C-allocation patterns.

The Arabidopsis TGA bZIP TF family comprises 10 members, of which PAN and TGA9/10 control flower developmental processes and TGA1/2/5/6 participate in stress-responses. For the TGA1 protein it was shown that several cysteines can be redox-dependently modified. TGA proteins interact in the nucleus with land plant-specific glutaredoxins, which may alter their activities posttranslationally. Here, we investigated the DNA-binding of PAN to the AAGAAT motif under different redox-conditions. The AAGAAT motif is localized in the second intron of the floral homeotic regulator AGAMOUS (AG), which controls stamen and carpel development as well as floral determinacy. Whereas PAN protein binds to this regulatory cis-element under reducing conditions, the interaction is strongly reduced under oxidizing conditions in EMSA studies. The redox-sensitive DNA-binding is mediated via a special PAN N-terminus, which is not present in other Arabidopsis TGA TFs and comprises five cysteines. Two N-terminal PAN cysteines, Cys68 and Cys87, were shown to form a disulfide bridge and Cys340, localized in a C-terminal putative transactivation domain, can be S-glutathionylated. Comparative land plant analyses revealed that the AAGAAT motif exists in asterid and rosid plant species. TGA TFs with N-terminal extensions of variable length were identified in all analyzed seed plants.

IADFs are intra-annual changes of wood density appearing as latewood-like cells within earlywood, or earlywood-like cells within latewood. The occurrence of IADFs is dependent on the age and size of the tree, and it is triggered by climatic drivers. The variations of IADF frequency of different species and their dependence on climate across a wide geographical range have still to be explored. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of age, tree-ring width and climate on IADF formation and frequency at a regional scale across the Mediterranean Basin in Pinus halepensis Mill., Pinus pinaster Ait., and Pinus pinea L. The analyzed tree-ring network was composed of P. pinea trees growing at 10 sites (2 in Italy, 4 in Spain, and 4 in Portugal), P. pinaster from 19 sites (2 in Italy, 13 in Spain, and 4 in Portugal), and P. halepensis from 38 sites in Spain. The correlations between IADF frequency and monthly minimum, mean and maximum temperatures, as well as between IADF frequency and total precipitation, were analyzed. A significant negative relationship between IADF frequency and tree-ring age was found for the three Mediterranean pines. Moreover, IADFs were more frequent in wider rings than in narrower ones, although the widest rings showed a reduced IADF frequency. Wet conditions during late summer/early autumn triggered the formation of IADFs in the three species. Our results suggest the existence of a common climatic driver for the formation of IADFs in Mediterranean pines, highlighting the potential use of IADF frequency as a proxy for climate reconstructions with geographical resolution."],"journal":"Frontiers in plant science","species":["Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus pinea","Pinus pinaster","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinaster","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus banksiana","Picea mariana","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus pinea","Pinus pinaster","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinea","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus pinea","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinea","Pinus pinaster","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinea","Pinus pinaster","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinea","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinaster","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinaster","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinea","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinea","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinea","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinaster","Pinus pinaster","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinaster"],"genera":["Pinus"]},"PMC4854333":{"title":["Gloger's rule in plants: The species and ecosystem levels."],"authors":["Lev-Yadun S."],"doi":["10.1080/15592324.2015.1040968"],"abstract":["Gloger's rule posits that darker birds are found more often in humid environments than in arid ones, especially in the tropics.

Growth and defense abilities of a pioneer (Pinus halepensis) and a late-successional (Quercus pubescens) Mediterranean forest species were evaluated under three different plant interference conditions: (i) allelopathy simulated by application of aqueous needle extracts of Pinus, (ii) resource competition created by the physical presence of a neighboring species (Pinus or Quercus), and (iii) a combination of both allelopathy and competition. After 24 months of experimentation in simulated field conditions, Quercus was more affected by plant interference treatments than was Pinus, and a hierarchical response to biotic interference (allelopathy < competition < allelopathy + competition) was observed in terms of relative impact on growth and plant defense. Both species modulated their respective metabolic profiles according to plant interference treatment and thus their inherent chemical defense status, resulting in a physiological trade-off between plant growth and production of defense metabolites. For Quercus, an increase in secondary metabolite production and a decrease in plant growth were observed in all treatments. In contrast, this trade-off in Pinus was only observed in competition and allelopathy + competition treatments.

Such horizontal transposon transfers, or HTTs, are relatively common within major eukaryotic kingdoms, including animals, plants, and fungi, while rarely occurring across these kingdoms. Here, we describe the first case of HTT from animals to plants, involving TEs known as Penelope-like elements, or PLEs, a group of retrotransposons closely related to eukaryotic telomerases. Using a combination of in situ hybridization on chromosomes, polymerase chain reaction experiments, and computational analyses we show that the predominant PLE lineage, EN(+)PLEs, is highly diversified in loblolly pine and other conifers, but appears to be absent in other gymnosperms. Phylogenetic analyses of both protein and DNA sequences reveal that conifers EN(+)PLEs, or Dryads, form a monophyletic group clustering within a clade of primarily arthropod elements. Additionally, no EN(+)PLEs were detected in 1,928 genome assemblies from 1,029 nonmetazoan and nonconifer genomes from 14 major eukaryotic lineages. These findings indicate that Dryads emerged following an ancient horizontal transfer of EN(+)PLEs from arthropods to a common ancestor of conifers approximately 340 Ma.

However, both the inherent infrequency, stochasticity and multiplicity of extreme climate events, and the array of biological responses, challenges investigations. To cope with the long life cycle of trees and the paucity of the extreme events themselves, our inferences should be based on long-term observations. In this context, tree rings and the related xylem anatomical traits represent promising sources of information, due to the wide time perspective and quality of the information they can provide. Here we test, on two high-elevation conifers (Larix decidua and Picea abies sampled at 2100 m a.s.l. in the Eastern Alps), the associations among temperature extremes during the growing season and xylem anatomical traits, specifically the number of cells per ring (CN), cell wall thickness (CWT), and cell diameter (CD). To better track the effect of extreme events over the growing season, tree rings were partitioned in 10 sectors. Climate variability has been reconstructed, for 1800-2011 at monthly resolution and for 1926-2011 at daily resolution, by exploiting the excellent availability of very long and high quality instrumental records available for the surrounding area, and taking into account the relationship between meteorological variables and site topographical settings. Summer temperature influenced anatomical traits of both species, and tree-ring anatomical profiles resulted as being associated to temperature extremes. Most of the extreme values in anatomical traits occurred with warm (positive extremes) or cold (negative) conditions. However, 0-34% of occurrences did not match a temperature extreme event. Specifically, CWT and CN extremes were more clearly associated to climate than CD, which presented a bias to track cold extremes.

These conditions are associated with decreased tree growth and increased vulnerability to pests and diseases. The anatomy of tree rings responds to these environmental conditions. Quantitatively, the width of a tree ring is largely determined by the rate and duration of cell division by the vascular cambium. In the Mediterranean climate, this division may occur throughout almost the entire year. Alternatively, cell division may cease during relatively cool and dry winters, only to resume in the same calendar year with milder temperatures and increased availability of water. Under particularly adverse conditions, no xylem may be produced in parts of the stem, resulting in a missing ring (MR). A dendrochronological network of Pinus halepensis was used to determine the relationship of MR to ECE. The network consisted of 113 sites, 1,509 trees, 2,593 cores, and 225,428 tree rings throughout the distribution range of the species. A total of 4,150 MR were identified. Binomial logistic regression analysis determined that MR frequency increased with increased cambial age. Spatial analysis indicated that the geographic areas of south-eastern Spain and northern Algeria contained the greatest frequency of MR. Dendroclimatic regression analysis indicated a non-linear relationship of MR to total monthly precipitation and mean temperature. MR are strongly associated with the combination of monthly mean temperature from previous October till current February and total precipitation from previous September till current May. They are likely to occur with total precipitation lower than 50 mm and temperatures higher than 5°C. This conclusion is global and can be applied to every site across the distribution area. Rather than simply being a complication for dendrochronology, MR formation is a fundamental response of trees to adverse environmental conditions. The demonstrated relationship of MR formation to ECE across this dendrochronological network in the Mediterranean basin shows the potential of MR analysis to reconstruct the history of past climatic extremes and to predict future forest dynamics in a changing climate."],"journal":"Frontiers in plant science","species":["Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus halepensis"],"genera":[]},"PMC4887491":{"title":["Osmolality and Non-Structural Carbohydrate Composition in the Secondary Phloem of Trees across a Latitudinal Gradient in Europe."],"authors":["Lintunen A, Paljakka T, Jyske T, Peltoniemi M, Sterck F, von Arx G, Cochard H, Copini P, Caldeira MC, Delzon S, Gebauer R, Grönlund L, Kiorapostolou N, Lechthaler S, Lobo-do-Vale R, Peters RL, Petit G, Prendin AL, Salmon Y, Steppe K, Urban J, Roig Juan S, Robert EM, Hölttä T."],"doi":["10.3389/fpls.2016.00726"],"abstract":["Phloem osmolality and its components are involved in basic cell metabolism, cell growth, and in various physiological processes including the ability of living cells to withstand drought and frost. Osmolality and sugar composition responses to environmental stresses have been extensively studied for leaves, but less for the secondary phloem of plant stems and branches. Leaf osmotic concentration and the share of pinitol and raffinose among soluble sugars increase with increasing drought or cold stress, and osmotic concentration is adjusted with osmoregulation. We hypothesize that similar responses occur in the secondary phloem of branches. We collected living bark samples from branches of adult Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies, Betula pendula and Populus tremula trees across Europe, from boreal Northern Finland to Mediterranean Portugal. In all studied species, the observed variation in phloem osmolality was mainly driven by variation in phloem water content, while tissue solute content was rather constant across regions. Osmoregulation, in which osmolality is controlled by variable tissue solute content, was stronger for Betula and Populus in comparison to the evergreen conifers. Osmolality was lowest in mid-latitude region, and from there increased by 37% toward northern Europe and 38% toward southern Europe due to low phloem water content in these regions. The ratio of raffinose to all soluble sugars was negligible at mid-latitudes and increased toward north and south, reflecting its role in cold and drought tolerance. For pinitol, another sugar known for contributing to stress tolerance, no such latitudinal pattern was observed. The proportion of sucrose was remarkably low and that of hexoses (i.e., glucose and fructose) high at mid-latitudes. The ratio of starch to all non-structural carbohydrates increased toward the northern latitudes in agreement with the build-up of osmotically inactive C reservoir that can be converted into soluble sugars during winter acclimation in these cold regions. Present results for the secondary phloem of trees suggest that adjustment with tissue water content plays an important role in osmolality dynamics. Furthermore, trees acclimated to dry and cold climate showed high phloem osmolality and raffinose proportion."],"journal":"Frontiers in plant science","species":["Populus tremula","Picea abies","Larix decidua","Populus tremula","Pinus sylvestris","Picea abies","Betula pendula","Populus tremula","Pinus sylvestris","Picea abies","Betula pendula","Populus tremula","Pinus sylvestris","Picea abies","Juglans regia","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea mariana","Picea abies","Picea mariana","Pinus sylvestris","Picea abies","Picea abies","Picea mariana","Picea abies","Picea abies","Larix decidua","Pinus cembra","Pinus sylvestris","Picea abies","Picea abies","Pinus sylvestris","Picea abies","Pinus sylvestris","Picea abies","Quercus robur"],"genera":["Betula","Populus","Pinus","Pinus","Populus","Pinus","Pinus","Picea","Pinus","Picea","Pinus","Picea","Pinus","Pinus"]},"PMC4892591":{"title":["Climate-Driven Synchronized Growth of Alpine Trees in the Southeast Tibetan Plateau."],"authors":["Zhou F, Fang K, Zhang F, Dong Z, Chen D."],"doi":["10.1371/journal.pone.0156126"],"abstract":["Knowledge about the spatiotemporal tree growth variability and its associations with climate provides key insights into forest dynamics under future scenarios of climate change. We synthesized 17 tree-ring width chronologies from four tree species at the high-elevation sites in the southeast Tibetan Plateau (SETP) to study the regional tree growth variability and climate-growth relationships. Despite of diverse habitats and different physiological characteristics of these species, these tree-ring chronologies shared a significant common variance in SETP. An unprecedented increase in the shared variance is found along the latter half of the 20th century, coinciding with the enhancement of the frequency of extreme rings among chronologies. It is found that minimum winter temperature tends to be the dominant climate for trees in this region. The site-specific responses in cold (1965-1980) and warm (1990-2005) intervals by means of Fuzzy Cmeans (FCM) clustering reveal that the remarkable enhancement of growth synchrony among trees mainly occur in warm conditions. This is different from previous findings indicating that increased consistence among temperature sensitive tree rings in cold periods. This may be related to the reduced temperature sensitivity of regional tree growth as winter minimum temperature is lower than a certain threshold, which is in agreement with the \"principle of ecological amplitude\". In addition, it is worth noting that precipitation in June have started to restrain the tree growth since the beginning of the 1980s, which is possibly an important contributor for synchronized growth among trees in SETP."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["A. forestii","P. likiangensis","T. dumosa","J. tibetica","A. forestii","P. likiangensis","J. tibetica","T. dumosa","A. forestii","J. tibetica","P. likiangensis","T. dumosa","P. likiangensis","A. forestii","J. tibetica","T. dumosa"],"genera":[]},"PMC4893459":{"title":["Are the metabolomic responses to folivory of closely related plant species linked to macroevolutionary and plant-folivore coevolutionary processes?"],"authors":["Rivas-Ubach A, Hódar JA, Sardans J, Kyle JE, Kim YM, Oravec M, Urban O, Guenther A, Peñuelas J."],"doi":["10.1002/ece3.2206"],"abstract":["The debate whether the coevolution of plants and insects or macroevolutionary processes (phylogeny) is the main driver determining the arsenal of molecular defensive compounds of plants remains unresolved.

To evaluate the extent of the physiological effect of moderate level sulfate and reactive nitrogen acidic deposition, we performed a retrospective dendrochronological analysis of several physiological parameters derived from periodic measurements of carbon stable isotope composition ((13)C discrimination, intercellular CO2 concentration and intrinsic water use efficiency) and annual diameter increments (tree biomass increment, its inter-annual variability and correlation with temperature, cloud cover, precipitation and Palmer drought severity index). The analysis was performed in two mountain Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands of the Bohemian Forest (Czech Republic, central Europe), where moderate levels of pollution peaked in the 1970s and 1980s and no evident impact on tree growth or link to mortality has been reported. The significant influence of pollution on trees was expressed most sensitively by a 1.88‰ reduction of carbon isotope discrimination (Δ(13)C). The effects of atmospheric pollution interacted with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and temperature. As a result, we observed no change in intercellular CO2 concentrations (Ci), an abrupt increase in water use efficiency (iWUE) and no change in biomass increment, which could also partly result from changes in carbon partitioning (e.g., from below- to above-ground). The biomass increment was significantly related to Δ(13)C on an individual tree level, but the relationship was lost during the pollution period. We suggest that this was caused by a shift from the dominant influence of the photosynthetic rate to stomatal conductance on Δ(13)C during the pollution period. Using biomass increment-climate correlation analyses, we did not identify any clear pollution-related change in water stress or photosynthetic limitation (since biomass increment did not become more sensitive to drought/precipitation or temperature/cloud cover, respectively). Therefore, we conclude that the direct effect of moderate pollution on stomatal conductance was likely the main driver of the observed physiological changes.

We aimed at (i) developing proxies for P 50 based on anatomical data assessed by SilviScan technology and (ii) testing these proxies for their plasticity regarding climate, in order to (iii) analyze annual variations of hydraulic proxies of healthy looking trees and trees with top dieback upon their impact on tree survival. At two sites we selected 10 tree pairs, i.e., one healthy looking tree and one tree with visual signs of dieback such as dry tops, needle shortening and needle yellowing (n = 40 trees). Vulnerability to cavitation (P 50) of the main trunk was assessed in a selected sample set (n = 19) and we thereafter applied SilviScan technology to measure cell dimensions (lumen (b) and cell wall thickness (t)) in these specimen and in all 40 trees in tree rings formed between 1990 and 2010. In a first analysis step, we searched for anatomical proxies for P 50. The set of potential proxies included hydraulic lumen diameters and wall reinforcement parameters based on mean, radial, and tangential tracheid diameters. The conduit wall reinforcement based on tangential hydraulic lumen diameters ((t/b ht)(2)) was the best estimate for P 50. It was thus possible to relate climatic extremes to the potential vulnerability of single annual rings. Trees with top dieback had significantly lower (t/b ht)(2) and wider tangential (hydraulic) lumen diameters some years before a period of water deficit (2005-2006). Radial (hydraulic) lumen diameters showed however no significant differences between both tree groups. (t/b ht)(2) was influenced by annual climate variability; strongest correlations were found with precipitation in September of the previous growing season: high precipitation in previous September resulted in more vulnerable annual rings in the next season.

Leaf mass and fine root mass plateaued between the 53- and ≥100-year-old stands, but leaf area index actually increased in the older stands. An increase in the leaf area index:fine root area ratio supports the idea that older stand are potentially limited by soil resources. Other factors contributing to slower growth in older stands might be lower soil temperatures and increased self-shading due to the clumped nature of crowns. Collectively, the proportionally greater reduction in fine roots in older stands might be the variable that predisposes these forests to be at a potentially greater risk of stress-induced mortality."],"journal":"Oecologia","species":["Pinus contorta","Pinus contorta","Vaccinium vitis","Hylocomium splendens","Pleurozium schreberi","Picea abies","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Dotted lines","Error bars","Pinus contorta","Pinus contorta"],"genera":[]},"PMC4912770":{"title":["Host species identity, site and time drive temperate tree phyllosphere bacterial community structure."],"authors":["Laforest-Lapointe I, Messier C, Kembel SW."],"doi":["10.1186/s40168-016-0174-1"],"abstract":["The increasing awareness of the role of phyllosphere microbial communities in plant health calls for a greater understanding of their structure and dynamics in natural ecosystems. Since most knowledge of tree phyllosphere bacterial communities has been gathered in tropical forests, our goal was to characterize the community structure and assembly dynamics of phyllosphere epiphytic bacterial communities in temperate forests in Quebec, Canada. We targeted five dominant tree species: Acer saccharum, Acer rubrum, Betula papyrifera, Abies balsamea, and Picea glauca. We collected 180 samples of phyllosphere communities on these species at four natural forest sites, three times during the growing season.Host functional traits (i.e., wood density, leaf nitrogen content) and climate variables (summer mean temperature and precipitation) were strongly correlated with community structure. We highlight three key findings: (1) temperate tree species share a \"core microbiome\"; (2) significant evolutionary associations exist between groups of bacteria and host species; and (3) a greater part of the variation in phyllosphere bacterial community assembly is explained by host species identity (27 %) and species-site interaction (14 %), than by site (11 %) or time (1 %).We demonstrated that host species identity is a stronger driver of temperate tree phyllosphere bacterial communities than site or time.

Still, many aspects of food choice have been hampered by time consuming procedures and methodological problems. Faster and cheaper methods, such as DNA metabarcoding, have therefore been widely adopted. However, there is still very little empirical support that this new method is better and more accurate compared to the classic methods. Here, we compare DNA metabarcoding to macroscopic identifications of rumen contents in two species of wild free-ranging ungulates: roe deer and fallow deer. We found that the methods were comparable, but they did not completely overlap. Sometimes the DNA method failed to identify food items that were found macroscopically, and the opposite was also true. However, the total number of taxa identified increased using DNA compared to the macroscopic analysis. Moreover, the taxonomic precision of metabarcoding was substantially higher, with on average 90% of DNA-sequences being identified to genus or species level compared to 75% of plant fragments using macroscopy. In niche overlap analyses, presence/absence data showed that both methods came to very similar conclusions. When using the sequence count data and macroscopic weight, niche overlap was lower than when using presence-absence data yet tended to increase when using DNA compared to macroscopy. Nevertheless, the significant positive correlation between macroscopic quantity and number of DNA sequences counted from the same plant group give support for the use of metabarcoding to quantify plants in the rumen. This study thus shows that there is much to be gained by using metabarcoding to quantitatively assess diet composition compared to macroscopic analysis, including higher taxonomic precision, sensitivity and cost efficiency."],"journal":"PloS one","species":["Capreolus capreolus","Cervus dama","Alces alces","Cervus elaphus","Ovis orientalis","Vulpes vulpes","Lynx lynx","Canis lupus","Acer platanoides","Achillea millefolium","Achillea ptarmica","Avena sativa","Matricaria perforata","Persicaria lapathifolia","Ranunculus repens","Rumex acetosella","Sorbus aucuparia","Stellaria graminea","Trifolium medium","Trifolium repens","Calluna vulgaris","Gymnocarpium dryopteris","Picea abies","Pinus sylvestris","Plantago major","Quercus robur","Rubus idaeus","Urtica dioica","Vaccinium myrtillus"],"genera":["Taraxacum"]},"PMC4919339":{"title":["Application of Somatic Embryogenesis in Woody Plants."],"authors":["Guan Y, Li SG, Fan XF, Su ZH."],"doi":["10.3389/fpls.2016.00938"],"abstract":["Somatic embryogenesis is a developmental process where a plant somatic cell can dedifferentiate to a totipotent embryonic stem cell that has the ability to give rise to an embryo under appropriate conditions.

Pollen carried by A. ipsilon moths was collected from 2012 to 2014 on a small island in the center of the Bohai Strait, which is a seasonal migration pathway of this pest species. Genomic DNA of single pollen grains was amplified by using whole genome amplification technology, and a portion of the chloroplast rbcL sequence was then amplified from this material. Pollen species were identified by a combination of DNA barcoding and pollen morphology. We found 28 species of pollen from 18 families on the tested moths, mainly from Angiosperm, Dicotyledoneae. From this, we were able to determine that these moths visit woody plants more than herbaceous plants that they carry more pollen in the early and late stages of the migration season, and that the amounts of pollen transportation were related to moth sex, moth body part, and plant species. In general, 31% of female and 26% of male moths were found to be carrying pollen. Amounts of pollen on the proboscis was higher for female than male moths, while the reverse was true for pollen loads on the antennae.

In this study, we aimed to examine whether such bottlenecks occurred during the initial speciation of two closely related spruce species Picea asperata and P. crassifolia occurring on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). We analyzed sequences of three chloroplast, two mitochondrial DNA fragments and a further 13 nuclear loci from 216 individuals of the two species. Both species showed a low level of genetic diversity in contrast to other congeners occurring in the QTP and adjacent regions. The estimated population sizes of P. asperata and P. crassifolia are less than the ancestral population size before splitting. These results together with multiple statistical tests (Tajima's D, Fu and Li's D* and F*) suggest that these two species underwent recent bottlenecks. Based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), we also determined that the period of the population shrinkage was consistent with the interspecific divergence during the late Pleistocene. The reduced population sizes and the divergent selection may together have triggered the initial divergence under high gene flow between these two species. Our results therefore highlight the importance of climatic oscillations during the late Pleistocene in promoting speciation through changing demographic sizes of the ancestral species on the QTP and in adjacent regions."],"journal":"Ecology and evolution","species":["Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea breweriana","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea likiangensis","Picea wilsonii","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea likiangensis","Picea wilsonii","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea likiangensis","Picea wilsonii","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia","Picea asperata","Picea crassifolia"],"genera":[]},"PMC4931021":{"title":["Glacial legacies on interglacial vegetation at the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition in NE Asia."],"authors":["Herzschuh U, Birks HJ, Laepple T, Andreev A, Melles M, Brigham-Grette J."],"doi":["10.1038/ncomms11967"],"abstract":["Broad-scale climate control of vegetation is widely assumed.

Vegetation-climate disequilibrium may persist for several millennia, related to the combined effects of permafrost persistence, distant glacial refugia and fire.

Scots pine forests have been disproportionally more affected by climate change triggered forest-dieback. Nevertheless, some Scots pine provenances might prove resilient to future drought events because of the species' large distributional range, genetic diversity, and adaptation potential. However, there is a lack of knowledge on provenance-specific survival under severe drought events and on how acclimation alters survival rates in Scots pine seedlings. We therefore conducted two drought-induced mortality experiments with potted Scots pine seedlings in a greenhouse. In the first experiment, 760 three-year-old seedlings from 12 different provenances of the south-western distribution range were subjected to the same treatment followed by the mortality experiment in 2014. In the second experiment, we addressed the question of whether acclimation to re-occurring drought stress events and to elevated temperature might decrease mortality rates. Thus, 139 four-year-old seedlings from France, Germany, and Poland were subjected to different temperature regimes (2012-2014) and drought treatments (2013-2014) before the mortality experiment in 2015. Provenances clearly differed in their hazard of drought-induced mortality, which was only partly related to the climate of their origin. Drought acclimation decreased the hazard of drought-induced mortality. Above-ground dry weight and height were the main determinants for the hazard of mortality, i.e., heavier and taller seedlings were more prone to mortality. Consequently, Scots pine seedlings exhibit a considerable provenance-specific acclimation potential against drought mortality and the selection of suitable provenances might thus facilitate seedling establishment and the persistence of Scots pine forest."],"journal":"Frontiers in plant science","species":["Fagus sylvatica","Picea abies","Pinus halepensis","Fagus sylvatica","Quercus pubescens","Pinus ponderosa","Pinus sylvestris","Picea ponderosa","Picea sylvestris","Picea sylvestris","Picea sylvestris","Picea sylvestris","Picea sylvestris","Fagus sylvatica","Picea ponderosa","Picea ponderosa","Pinus taeda"],"genera":[]},"PMC4937839":{"title":["Soybean Cyst Nematode Resistance Emerged via Artificial Selection of Duplicated Serine Hydroxymethyltransferase Genes."],"authors":["Wu XY, Zhou GC, Chen YX, Wu P, Liu LW, Ma FF, Wu M, Liu CC, Zeng YJ, Chu AE, Hang YY, Chen JQ, Wang B."],"doi":["10.3389/fpls.2016.00998"],"abstract":["A major soybean (Forrest cultivar) quantitative trait locus (QTL) gene, Rhg4, which controls resistance to soybean cyst nematodes (SCN), encodes the enzyme serine hydroxylmethyltransferase (SHMT). The resistant allele possesses two critical missense mutations (P130R and N358Y) compared to that of the sensitive allele, rhg4. To understand the evolutionary history of this gene, sequences of 117 SHMT family members from 18 representative plant species were used to reconstruct their phylogeny. According to this phylogeny, the plant SHMT gene family can be divided into two groups and four subgroups (Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb). Belonging to the Subgroup Ia lineage, the rhg4 gene evolved from a recent duplication event in Glycine sp.. To further explore how the SCN-resistant allele emerged, both the rhg4 gene and its closest homolog, the rhg4h gene, were isolated from 33 cultivated and 68 wild soybean varieties. The results suggested that after gene duplication, the soybean rhg4 gene accumulated a higher number of non-synonymous mutations than rhg4h. Although a higher number of segregating sites and gene haplotypes were detected in wild soybeans than in cultivars, the SCN-resistant Rhg4 allele (represented by haplotype 4) was not found in wild varieties. Instead, a very similar allele, haplotype 3, was observed in wild soybeans at a frequency of 7.4%, although it lacked the two critical non-synonymous substitutions. Taken together, these findings support that the SCN-resistant Rhg4 allele likely emerged via artificial selection during the soybean domestication process, based on a SCN-sensitive allele inherited from wild soybeans."],"journal":"Frontiers in plant science","species":["Heterodera glycines","Glycine soja","Glycine max","Glycine soja","Chlamydomonas reinhardtii","Ostreococcus lucimarinus","Physcomitrella patens","Selaginella moellendorffii","Picea abies","Amborella trichopoda","Oryza sativa","Brachypodium distachyon","Sorghum bicolor","Amborella lyrata","Brassica rapa","Medicago truncatula","Glycine max","Phaseolus vulgaris","Mimulus guttatus","Solanum lycopersicum","Selaginella tuberosum","Escherichia coli","Chlamydomonas reinhardtii","Ostreococcus lucimarinus","Selaginella moellendorffii","Amborella trichopoda","Physcomitrella abies","Arabidopsis thaliana","Amborella thaliana","Amborella lyrata","Amborella trichopoda","Amborella thaliana"],"genera":["Forrest","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Glycine","Arabidopsis","Medicago","Phaseolus","Glycine","Phaseolus","Glycine","Medicago","Glycine","Forrest","Peiking","Glycine"]},"PMC4938651":{"title":["Identifying Genetic Signatures of Natural Selection Using Pooled Population Sequencing in Picea abies."],"authors":["Chen J, Källman T, Ma XF, Zaina G, Morgante M, Lascoux M."],"doi":["10.1534/g3.116.028753"],"abstract":["The joint inference of selection and past demography remain a costly and demanding task.

Sap flow, meteorological factors and predawn needle water potential were continuously monitored throughout one growing season across Smith fir (Abies georgei var. smithii) and juniper (Juniperus saltuaria) treelines in southeast Tibet. Sap flow started in early May and corresponded to a threshold mean air-temperature of 0°C. Across tree species, transpiration was mainly limited by low soil temperature prior to the summer solstice but by vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation post-summer solstice, which was further confirmed on a daily scale. As a result, tree transpiration for both tree species was significantly reduced in the pre-summer solstice period as compared to post-summer solstice, resulting in a lower predawn needle water potential for Smith fir trees in the early growing season.

Phe is used as a protein building block but it is also as a precursor for numerous plant compounds that are crucial for plant reproduction, growth, development, and defense against different types of stresses. The metabolism of Phe plays a central role in the channeling of carbon from photosynthesis to the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids. The study of this metabolic pathway is particularly relevant in trees, which divert large amounts of carbon into the biosynthesis of Phe-derived compounds, particularly lignin, an important constituent of wood. The trunks of trees are metabolic sinks that consume a considerable percentage of carbon and energy from photosynthesis, and carbon is finally immobilized in wood. This paper reviews recent advances in the biosynthesis and metabolic utilization of Phe in conifer trees. Two alternative routes have been identified: the ancient phenylpyruvate pathway that is present in microorganisms, and the arogenate pathway that possibly evolved later during plant evolution. Additionally, an efficient nitrogen recycling mechanism is required to maintain sustained growth during xylem formation. The relevance of phenylalanine metabolic pathways in wood formation, the biotic interactions, and ultraviolet protection is discussed. The genetic manipulation and transcriptional regulation of the pathways are also outlined."],"journal":"Frontiers in plant science","species":["Picea glauca","Picea abies","Pinus taeda","Picea radiata","Picea pinaster","Picea radiata","Liquidambar styraciflua","Arabidopsis thaliana","Pinus pinaster","Picea pinaster","Arabidopsis thaliana","Picea pinaster","Picea taeda","Picea abies","Picea abies","Heterobasidion annosum","Picea sylvestris","Picea abies","Picea sylvestris","Eucalyptus grandis","Picea taeda","Arabidopsis thaliana","Oryza sativa","Glycine max","Populus trichocarpa","Eucalyptus grandis","Picea pinaster","Picea trichocarpa","Eucalyptus grandis","Picea abies","Picea glauca","Picea pinaster","Physcomitrella patens","Picea glauca","Picea glauca"],"genera":["Populus","Pinaceae","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Eucalyptus","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Arabidopsis","Populus"]},"PMC4943178":{"title":["Revisiting the Plastid Phylogenomics of Pinaceae with Two Complete Plastomes of Pseudolarix and Tsuga."],"authors":["Sudianto E, Wu CS, Lin CP, Chaw SM."],"doi":["10.1093/gbe/evw106"],"abstract":["Phylogeny of the ten Pinaceous genera has long been contentious.

Hydraulic parameters of the roots were compared with those of the stem and related to anatomical traits {mean conduit diameter (d), wall reinforcement [(t/b)(2)]}. We hypothesized that temperature-related restrictions in root function would cause a progressive limitation of hydraulic efficiency and safety with increasing elevation.

We examined long-standing hypotheses experimentally that sand binding, inter-specific interactions, abiotic factors and seedling recruitment are drivers of sand dune plant community structure in Sardinia, Italy. Removing foundation species from the fore-, middle- and back-dune habitats over three years led to erosion and habitat loss on the fore-dune and limited plant recovery that increased with dune elevation. Reciprocal species removals in all zones suggested that inter-specific competition is common, but that dominance is transient, particularly due to sand burial disturbance in the middle-dune. A fully factorial 2-year manipulation of water, nutrient availability and substrate stability revealed no significant proximate response to these physical factors in any dune zone. In the fore- and middle-dune, plant seeds are trapped under adult plants during seed germination, and seedling survivorship and growth generally increase with dune height in spite of increased herbivory in the back-dune. Sand and seed erosion leads to limited seed recruitment on the fore-dune while high summer temperatures and preemption of space lead to competitive dominance of woody plants in the back-dune. Our results suggest that Sardinian sand dune plant communities are organized hierarchically, structured by sand binding foundation species on the fore-dune, sand burial in the middle-dune and increasingly successful seedling recruitment, growth and competitive dominance in the back-dune."],"journal":"PeerJ","species":["Armeria pungens","Lotus cytisoides","Carpobrotus acinaciformis","Pinus halepensis","Pinus pinea","Cakile maritima","Pancratium maritimum","Otanthus maritimus","Ephedra distachya","Helicrysum microphyllum","Acacia cyanophylla","Juniperus macrocarpa","Juniperus phoenicea","Armeria pungens","Lotus cytisoides","Carpobrotus acinaciformis","Astragalus thermensis"],"genera":["Armeria","Carpobrotus","Pancratium","Carpobrotus","Carpobrotus","Carpobrotus","Carpobrotus","Carpobrotus","Pinus","Pinus","Pinus","Pinus","Pinus","Pinus","Pinus","Pinus","Carpobrotus","Pinus","Pinus","Carpobrotus","Lotus","Pinus","Carpobrotus","Pinus","Lotus","Pinus","Armeria","Lotus","Carpobrotus","Pinus","Pinus","Pinus","Armeria","Otanthus","Lotus","Armeria","Ephedra","Armeria","Armeria","Armeria","Carpobrotus","Pinus","Armeria","Lotus","Carpobrotus","Armeria","Lotus","Armeria","Lotus","Carpobrotus","Armeria","Carpobrotus","Pinus","Armeria","Pinus","Armeria","Otanthus","Armeria","Armeria","Lotus","Lotus","Lotus","Pancratium","Armeria","Carpobrotus","Carpobrotus","Armeria","Armeria","Cakile","Armeria","Otanthus","Carpobrotus","Carpobrotus","Carpobrotus","Carpobrotus","Pinus","Armeria","Lotus","Pinus","Armeria","Pinus","Pinus","Pancratium","Lotus","Pinus","Pinus","Pancratium","Pinus","Carpobrotus","Carpobrotus","Carpobrotus","Pinus","Armeria","Pinus","Carpobrotus","Carpobrotus","Pinus","Pinus","Pinus","Pinus","Pinus","Pinus","Carpobrotus","Pinus","Carpobrotus","Pinus"]},"PMC4951524":{"title":["Increased Needle Nitrogen Contents Did Not Improve Shoot Photosynthetic Performance of Mature Nitrogen-Poor Scots Pine Trees."],"authors":["Tarvainen L, Lutz M, Räntfors M, Näsholm T, Wallin G."],"doi":["10.3389/fpls.2016.01051"],"abstract":["Numerous studies have shown that temperate and boreal forests are limited by nitrogen (N) availability. However, few studies have provided a detailed account of how carbon (C) acquisition of such forests reacts to increasing N supply. We combined measurements of needle-scale biochemical photosynthetic capacities and continuous observations of shoot-scale photosynthetic performance from several canopy positions with simple mechanistic modeling to evaluate the photosynthetic responses of mature N-poor boreal Pinus sylvestris to N fertilization. The measurements were carried out in August 2013 on 90-year-old pine trees growing at Rosinedalsheden research site in northern Sweden. In spite of a nearly doubling of needle N content in response to the fertilization, no effect on the long-term shoot-scale C uptake was recorded. This lack of N-effect was due to strong light limitation of photosynthesis in all investigated canopy positions. The effect of greater N availability on needle photosynthetic capacities was also constrained by development of foliar phosphorus (P) deficiency following N addition. Thus, P deficiency and accumulation of N in arginine appeared to contribute toward lower shoot-scale nitrogen-use efficiency in the fertilized trees, thereby additionally constraining tree-scale responses to increasing N availability. On the whole our study suggests that the C uptake response of the studied N-poor boreal P. sylvestris stand to enhanced N availability is constrained by the efficiency with which the additional N is utilized. This efficiency, in turn, depends on the ability of the trees to use the greater N availability for additional light capture. For stands that have not reached canopy closure, increase in leaf area following N fertilization would be the most effective way for improving light capture and C uptake while for mature stands an increased leaf area may have a rather limited effect on light capture owing to increased self-shading. This raises the question if N limitation in boreal forests acts primarily by constraining growth of young stands while the commonly recorded increase in stem growth of mature stands following N addition is primarily the result of altered allocation and only to a limited extent the result of increased stand C-capture."],"journal":"Frontiers in plant science","species":["Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Picea abies","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus pinaster","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris","Pinus sylvestris"],"genera":[]},"PMC4963410":{"title":["Highlighting the Need for Systems-Level Experimental Characterization of Plant Metabolic Enzymes."],"authors":["Engqvist MKM."],"abstract":["The biology of living organisms is determined by the action and interaction of a large number of individual gene products, each with specific functions. Discovering and annotating the function of gene products is key to our understanding of these organisms. Controlled experiments and bioinformatic predictions both contribute to functional gene annotation. For most species it is difficult to gain an overview of what portion of gene annotations are based on experiments and what portion represent predictions. Here, I survey the current state of experimental knowledge of enzymes and metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana as well as eleven economically important crops and forestry trees – with a particular focus on reactions involving organic acids in central metabolism. I illustrate the limited availability of experimental data for functional annotation of enzymes in most of these species. Many enzymes involved in metabolism of citrate, malate, fumarate, lactate, and glycolate in crops and forestry trees have not been characterized. Furthermore, enzymes involved in key biosynthetic pathways which shape important traits in crops and forestry trees have not been characterized. I argue for the development of novel high-throughput platforms with which limited functional characterization of gene products can be performed quickly and relatively cheaply. I refer to this approach as systems-level experimental characterization. The data collected from such platforms would form a layer intermediate between bioinformatic gene function predictions and in-depth experimental studies of these functions. Such a data layer would greatly aid in the pursuit of understanding a multiplicity of biological processes in living organisms."],"journal":"Frontiers in Plant Science","species":[],"genera":[]},"PMC4963455":{"title":["Trichoderma species occurring on wood with decay symptoms in mountain forests in Central Europe: genetic and enzymatic characterization."],"authors":["Błaszczyk L, Strakowska J, Chełkowski J, Gąbka-Buszek A, Kaczmarek J."],"doi":["10.1007/s13353-015-0326-1"],"abstract":["The aim of this study was to explore the species diversity of Trichoderma obtained from samples of wood collected in the forests of the Gorce Mountains (location A), Karkonosze Mountains (location B) and Tatra Mountains (location C) in Central Europe and to examine the cellulolytic and xylanolytic activity of these species as an expression of their probable role in wood decay processes.

Chloroplast genetic engineering is an exciting field to engineer several valuable tree traits.

Comparison of their chloroplast genomes revealed three unique inversions found in the downstream of the gene clusters and evolutionary divergence were found, although overall the chloroplast genomic structure of the Cupressaceae linage was conserved. We also investigated the phylogenetic position of Chinese fir among conifers by examining gene functions, selection forces, substitution rates, and the full chloroplast genome sequence. Consistent with previous molecular systematics analysis, the results provided a well-supported phylogeny framework for the Cupressaceae that strongly confirms the \"basal\" position of Cunninghamia lanceolata. The structure of the Cunninghamia lanceolata chloroplast genome showed a partial lack of one IR copy, rearrangements clearly occurred and slight evolutionary divergence appeared among the cp genome of C. lanceolata, Taiwania cryptomerioides, Taiwania flousiana, Calocedrus formosana and Cryptomeria japonica.
